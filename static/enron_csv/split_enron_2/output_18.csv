Attached below are the two files for TW CMS/TMS requirements on flow direction and current process for inside/outside the path requirements. 

Please review these documents and let me know if you have any questions or  corrections to apply to either document by COB
8/31/01. 

Linda, please keep me in the loop on both of the projects since they interface directly with TMS.

Thanks Ramona

Everyone,

With lots of great help from Bert and Beverly, a timeline of the Transwestern confirmation process with El Paso has been documented and is attached.  Also, at the bottom of this attachment are several issues that have been identified in looking at the EDI process.  I will be getting a meeting together either Friday or early next week to discuss.

As of today, we have e:mailed a list by station ( 7 and/or 16 day charts) t=
o the Measurement Group that need to be read for PPA's to correct the daily=
 volumes for the following shippers:

MidAmerican - 147 stations - to date, Measurement has corrected 44 stations

IES - 87 stations

Interstate Power - 6 stations

Wisconsin Power & Light - 11 stations

In order for us to keep track of the ones that need to be corrected, we wou=
ld like for Measurement to send us updates as to what station numbers have =
or haven't been done.  We would also like to make sure that they have even =
received all of these October, 2001 charts by December 14 and if they haven=
't, we would like to know which ones they are so that we could help by call=
ing the field personnel to get those charts in ASAP and also, if we could d=
o that for them, then they could continue to input the corrected readings w=
hile we chase down the charts they are missing.  We have given Measurement =
a date of January 3, 2002 (which is the last time that we run prior periods=
) for the date that we would like to have all of these done, but the sooner=
 they get those done, the better because we would like to have plenty of ti=
me to review them and make sure that they are correct.  To make that happen=
, it would help us if they could be done by December 19, which will be the =
first time that we run prior periods.  If we wait until the January 3rd dat=
e, we will only have 1 day to check these invoices to make sure that they a=
re all correct.

Lynn/Rick, I think that Jodie and I need your help in conveying this to Mea=

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - An Internet worm that leaves infected computers vulnerable to future hacking by tracking what is typed on the keyboard, including passwords and credit card details, was spreading rapidly on Monday, computer security companies warned. 
The worm, called ``Badtrans,'' spreads through Microsoft Corp. Outlook or Outlook Express e-mail programs and automatically sends itself to unanswered e-mails in inboxes, according to several antivirus companies. 
The attachment, which contains the malicious program, can be executed simply by reading or previewing it and doesn't need to be double clicked or opened separately, experts said. 
The worm contains a keystroke logger, which can be used to record what people type to obtain passwords and credit card numbers, they said. 
``It does no damage to files but does drop a backdoor trojan on the machine which would allow a hacker to come back and access personal information,'' said April Goostree, virus research manager at McAfee. 
While corporate e-mail gateways are blocking the worm, many home and small office computer users who aren't up-to-date on their antivirus software are getting infected, she said. 
The subject line varies, often assuming the text of the unanswered e-mail whose e-mail address it co-opts. The name of the attachment varies as well, with suffixes including .doc,. pics, and. news. 
The worm, a variant of one discovered in April, has hit at least 50 countries, with most infections in Germany, followed by the UK and United States, said UK-based MessageLabs, which reported receiving 400 copies an hour this weekend.

Subject:	FYI - 637 Imbal Mtg

We held a meeting to discuss the status of TW's 637 Imbalance filing.  Our current position (after discussions about a month ago) has been that we are concerned about filing anything in the 637 docket because it would stir-up segmentation and for now we want to let that sleeping dog lie.  We discussed again the possibility of making a separate tariff filing to pursue our OBA ""wish list"" outside the 637 arena and decided again that this type of filing would just get consolidated with our pending 637 filing.

After further discussion we decided that the one thing, most narrowly defined, that would really help us out with our imbalances is mandatory cash-out in constrained areas.  If defined this narrowly, this is something for which we can clearly demonstrate an operational need based upon historical allocation and imbalance data.  We think that we could make a 30 day tariff filing for this one change and have minimum risk of entanglement with the overall 637 filing.

Glen & Mary are going to discuss with MKM and Teb with Rob.  Lyn & Terry are going to pull together the last 12 months of data for constrained areas on our pipe (Ignacio to Blanco, Blanco to Thoreau, Thoreau to the border & check with Darrell for any other areas that should be included) and increased imbalance levels.  We plan to get together next week to discuss further.

Concerning the rest of our OBA ""wish list"", we are discussing whether to hold meetings with individual protestors to discuss only the Imbalance issues of the filing and work toward a ""settlement"" position on those issues to have ready in the event of Commission action in this docket."

5% of MDQ daily not monthly

Subject:	RE: OneOk Field Services November Invoice Issues

I've talked with Vernon.  I can see Dari's point.  Since I will be out of town 12/11-12/12 when final allocated volumes come out, Vernon will work with Gas Logistics to do a Split Path manual, if necessary, to override the max overrun (OVA) rate with the firm rate.  When I get back, I will create tariff exception(s) reflecting the manuals to keep our records straight.  The MID-to-MID level tiered overrun discount will require manual review each month.  If shipper flows more than 5% overrun overall on any day, discounts may have to be entered at the path level to prevent discounting more overrun than the deal permits.

Affects 2 contracts: 108437 & 108489.  Tiered OVA discounts are currently entered on from several field MIDs to MID 16A, providing a discount on the first 1750/day on 108437 and 3675/day for 108489.
In practice, TAS will discount the first 1750 or 3675/day on each individual path.  If 108489 flows 3000 overrun on each of 2 different MID 1- to MID 16A paths in a day, TAS will apply the discount to a total overrun volume of 6000.

Another Question:  Vernon - Are you wanting to discount overrun equal to up to 5% of the contract MDQ on a daily basis, or on a monthly basis?  For example, on 108489, MDQ=73,500 so 5%=3675.  Is it your intention to discount only up to 3675 overrun each day, or would you discount up to 3675*30=110,250 Overrun for the month, regardless of daily flow levels?

Rita,

Not to complicate things, but, they have authorized overrun on thier contract for up to 5% of the MDQ at the contract rate (demand + commodity).  So there is a rate in the system for overrun as a tiered rate in the authorized overrun classification.

I wouldn't want to do a discount because of ""full rate equivalent"" issues. I like the exception better with a note in a file or something to explain it.  But I defer to Steve on this.

Importance:	High

Here are my 2 suggestions for the ONEOK dilemma

1) just discount Overrun down to max firm for the days when ONEOK nominated incorrectly and put an explanation of the circumstances in the Comment box.
2) I could create a Tariff Exception on the ONEOK contract for the days in question, setting the Overrun rate equal to the firm rate.  Then it would not look like a discount.  However, there is no way to attach a comment to an exception.

Considerations:
The Transactional report will not pick up a post-dated discount (but this isn't really a discount).
The discount (but not the exception) would show up on the 592 report - but nobody reads that, anyway.
When they nominated as max rate overrun, it got scheduled.  Since they had a right to firm service, they would have been scheduled if they had nominated correctly, so they didn't really get an unfair advantage over other TI.

Steve & Dari - what do you think?

Lynn,

Earlier this month, I noticed that OneOk Field Services incorrectly nominated 100% of their firm commodity as overrun.  I pointed this out to Joe Linhart and he got OneOk to correct it for the balance of the month.  Joe informed me that for the activity that had already been scheduled as overrun prior to that date couldn't be changed without a lot of work and it would be easier for me just to put in an overrun discount to get the invoice to come out correctly.  Since rates are directly linked to our publicly available FERC mandated reporting, I did not think that doctoring our rates would be the best solution either.  

Do you have an idea on another way to correct this or of the two options we have which do you think is the best way to correct this before the commodity invoices go out on the 10th?

Thanks!
Vernon"

Comments on the Pipeline Interconnect Forum draft meeting minutes are due today.  I've looked through the minutes, but have not had the time to draft my comments and revisions.  Portions of the minutes need to be revised and should not be distributed to anyone else as is.  The minutes include some misinformation, and most statements have someone's name associated with them.

I know it is difficult, if not impossible, for one person to accurately capture everything that was discussed or stated during a day-long meeting.  My comments in no way reflect on Todd or his note taking abilities.  At our next meeting I would like to discuss our meeting minutes and the extent of the discussion that we try to capture.  Without a transcript, capturing all of the details of the entire day's discussion is impossible.

I would like to extend the comment date one week to next Friday, December 14.  This will give me time to draft and submit comments.

Thank you for your assistance,

*****  Attention Remote Access Users - Important Update  *****

There is now an interim solution in place for your remote access needs.

Please use 713-440-4221 or 866-295-3813 for dial-up access.

Windows 2000:

VPN access for Windows 2000 is fully operational.  Either the VPN without iPass option can be used, or a connection may be created manually using the same settings as VPN without iPass.  For users who are dialing in, creating a Dial-Up connection using either number listed above with the default settings will work.  You must be sure to append the domain name to the user id (i.e.. CORP\rbarker) for the connection to be successful.

Windows 9x:

Dial-Up access is working provided that Dial-Up Networking version 1.4 is installed on the system.  Dial-Up Networking version 1.4 can be downloaded from http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;q285189.  Follow the instructions for installation.  VPN access for Windows 9x has not yet been verified.  Dial-Up connections using either number listed above should be setup using the default settings.

Windows NT:

Dial-Up access for Windows NT4 is working provided that Service Pack 6a has been installed on the system.  Service Pack 6a may be obtained from http://www.microsoft.com/ntserver/nts/downloads/recommended/SP6/128bitX86/default.asp. Follow the instructions for installation.  VPN access for Windows NT4 has not yet been verified.  Dial-Up connections using either number listed above should be setup using the default settings.

This information is also available on the ETS Solution Center website at http://www.ets.enron.com/Services/Solution_Center/default.asp under Quick Reference - Remote Access with additional information about setting up a Dial-Up connection.

Please keep in mind that the Remote Access situation is changing rapidly.  You will be notified as additional information or updates become available.

Here is the file you sent me with the following changes:

1.  Question 1: added a comment line after the column headings explaining that Interruptible contracts may be extended from month to month unless terminated on 30 days' notice by either party.  Mary Kay thought we needed some explanation why those contracts showed termination dates in the past.  I eliminated this line, along with the headers, on the CD version of the file.

2.  Question 3:  I just changed the alignment on the text cells for the 3 comment records at the bottom from Centered to Left.

It appears to me that these should be expedited for completion because it would help reduce the number of late charts. My understanding is that some of these stations have been converted for some time. sj

Lynn, I spoke to Dan Fancler this morning and he said to leave the NNG Nom. alone for now. James Centilli is working on a solution for TW and will let us know how to proceed. Jean Adams, myself as well as other team members continue to monitor the ENA nominations on NNG.

Lynn, We received a call that indicates Enron Compressor Services is not in Bankruptcy.  The TW gas may need to move on a Enron Compressor Services contract, or we may need to schedule the gas on an ENA receipt contract and cashout the imbalance.  If ENA can not move the gas, the gas that ENA leaves on the system will need to be sold by TW.  Not sure if ENA has a market to move the gas.

The NNG Compressor Services gas is still being scheduled.  2,010 dt/day

James Centilli is working with Mark K. and Greg Porter and may know more.  We need to meet to discuss how this contract goes forward.

Teb Lokey called to discuss the accounting of the gas given to ENA for the Ele compressors.  

ENA can not transport the gas TW gives them.  

There are a lot of unknowns at this time, I am requesting James Centilli keep us informed of what the new deal will look like."

	Gary and Caroline, as of today, we have emailed a list by station (7 and/or 16 day charts) to the measurement
	group which needs to be read for PPA's to correct the daily volumes fro the following shippers:

		MidAmerican - 147 stations (It is my understanding you have already 44 of the 147)
		IES - 87 stations
		Interstate Power - 6 stations
		Wisconsin Power and Light - 11 stations

	In order for Gas Logistics to keep track of the ones that need to be corrected, we would like for Measurement to send 
	us updates on the following information ASAP:

		1.  Which station numbers have or have not been corrected for October.

		2.  How many October charts have been received and how many are outstanding

		3.  Provide status of November chart information.

	Gas Logistics needs the October corrections in the system by December 19th, which is the time
	frame for the first prior period run.  This is important for us to be able to review the prior period invoices.
	As you 	find there are missing charts, if we can be of assistance in calling the field, please let us know. 
	This way, the measurement group can concentrate on reading the charts.

	We appreciate your assistance and help in tracking these prior periods and helping each of us to keep focused
	to get these prior period corrections done by the next months billing.  If you have any questions, please let
	Rick or I know.  Thanks. Lynn

I am in the process of  getting a list together of data elements Gas Logistics would want to have available in a universe. Also, there is an upgrade of Business Objects underway which involves utilization of new server and I have been involved in testing reports using the upgrade.

Due to the complications I am having with my right eye following the Lasik Enhancement, I am going to be going to the eye doctor more frequently than planned.

I have another appointment at the eye doctor tomorrow Thursday, the 13th @ 2:15 pm.  Since this will basically consume most of the afternoon I went ahead and made a follow-up appointment with my primary care doctor.  He has increased my diabetes Rx and needs to evaluate it's effectiveness.

Hi  Lynn,
 
Hadn't had a chance  to touch base with you since all of the Enron problems.  Wanted to let you  know how badly I feel for everything that has happened.  Enron is too fine  a company to have something like this happen.  You have so many great  employees in the organization.  Many, like yourself, I consider to be not  only business associates, but friends.
 
I just wanted to  send a quick note expressing my sorrow for all the stress you and others are  having to endure.  We support you 100%.  Things will get better.   
 
Hopefully, you can  find some joy in the upcoming holiday season.
 
Sincerely,
Bill

Lynn,

In reviewing the Duke contract 27291, I did find that the rate was not correct for four months in the past year.  I also reviewed Duke contract 27349 since it also had the same type of alternate to California deal.  Two months on the second contract were not billed correctly.  If Marketing can input the correct rates into the system, I can regenerate the invoices and bill Duke immediately.  Please see the attached file for details.

Thanks,  Bert

	Team, I realize this rate change is done in Marketing.  But, you have a responsibility
	to review the invoice to ensure that the adjustment to the price has been made if
	there is alternate deliveries.  Let's be proactive to ensure we have accurate billing.
	If you have any questions, please let me know.

This adjustment will result in approximately $7800 in additional revenues.  

One way to prevent this situation in the future would be for the rep and or myself to ensure that Duke's rate has been increased when they have alternate deliveries to the border.   If these alternate deliveries exist and the rate has not been increased then the rep needs to bring this situation to the attention of the marketer.

FYI - In working to load rates for the FERC California reporting requirements, it appears that for the last four months Duke Energy T & M contract #27291 has not been billed the incremental fee of $0.06/dth for alternate deliveries to the Cal Border (over and above the base discount negotiated for the contracted primary points).

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Subject:	OBA & Scheduling Alt FT by Price Tariff Filings

In an effort to get cash in the door for TW and to maximize revenue opportunity for TW in the coming year, I think we should look at getting two proposals on file with the FERC as soon as possible. 

One would be the OBA filing we have been discussing (and trying to support with historical data) to get automatic cash-out on OBA's in ""constrained"" areas on TW.

Second would be to look at filing for scheduling by price at alternate FT points.  This may be the time (the market to California is not so hot) to try to implement this.  I know we will have to look hard at the cost of the system modifications required and whether we can justify them.  

Glen is already scheduling a meeting next week for further discussion of the OBA tariff filing.  Could we discuss scheduling alternate FT by price at the same meeting?"

Frank,

This email will confirm that MidAmerican will not be paid for the November gas purchase amount of $1,558,687.65, since they have already shortpaid their transportation invoice by this amount.  I spoke with Mark Walton in Finance this afternoon, and he said that they are aware of the situation and have already taken the appropriate actions to cancel the wire transfer that would have gone out to MidAmerican later this month.

Also, FYI,  I did check with the Contracts Group about payment terms in GISB agreements.  Section 7.2 of the GISB form stipulates the payment date as being the 25th day of the month following the month of delivery.

I spoke with Renee Perry in Gas Logistics this afternoon, and she is looking into compiling an invoice for finance charges on the balance shortpaid for the period November 12th - November 25th.

Please call me if you need further information.

Thanks,

Kay"

Of interest -
Gas Logistics combined 2001 payroll is $8,209,648.  The 2002 Plans were built with a 4.25% combined merit and other which equates to $348,910.  At 3.75% the combined merit and other equates to $307,862, a reduction of $41,048.  Over the next few days, I will be rebuilding the 2002 revised plan for distribution.

	On September 24, 2001, Alice gave each of you a list of your outstanding accounts receivable
	back to January, 1998.  In meeting with Alice today, I understand, we have NOT cleaned up very
	many of these issues.
	
	Alice will be getting with each one of you AGAIN to review your accounts.  My expectation is
	that there has been some clean up activity before Performance Reviews at which time I will
	ask Alice for an update.  Alice, Raetta and Larry are all available as needed to help you in
	this effort.

	All clean up should be completed by December 31, 2001."

Lynn, any update yet from Gary or Caroline as to the updates you requested in your December 11 email?  I am finalizing a letter to Alliant and would like to provide them with an expectation as to the October PPA's.  Specifically, will all the October charts be corrected?

Further, Alliant wants Gas Logistics to tag the PPA's.  Specifically, Alliant requested the differences are identified by gate and amount of change.  Is this possible?

Some of you may encounter a problem with your paycheck inquiry when you try to access current pay period totals.  It may only show year-to-date totals, not current pay period results.  There was evidently a test run on payroll on 12/11 with no dollar amount involved.  That is what you will see.  To get this pay period's results:

	1) Access eHRonline  2)Pay Information  3) Paycheck Inquiry
	4) Select P/R Results - two options, click on results in period
	5) Click on the results 12/01/2001 - 12/15/2001

Assistants, please forward to your respective groups.

Subject:	Gas Tariff Issues at Winkler Co. Point - DRN 42599

For several days recently, gas received at the referenced receipt point has
exceeded the tariff levels for total diluents.  At the present time, the
Winkler Co. receipt point is shut-in because of excess Nitrogen.  Recently
we have been allowing this gas to be delivered at Waha (DRN 68517) instead
of the Winkler Co. (DRN 42599) point.  This is causing large imbalances at
each point which may or may not be able to be offset with each other.  We
would prefer that the gas be received as scheduled at each receipt point.

As stated in the EPNG Tariff under section 5.1.f under Gas Quality:

Diluents  -  The gas shall not at any time contain in excess of three
percent (3%) total diluents (the total combined carbon dioxide, nitrogen,
helium, oxygen, and any other diluent compound) by volume, except for gas
applicable to Sections 5.2 and 5.3.

Sections 5.2 and 5.3 cover receipt locations which have grand-fathered
contracts and arrangements.

While we try to work with our customers when there are slight variations of
the gas quality specifications during customer maintenance activities, it is
important that our customers understand that their gas must meet the
specifications set forth in the tariff.  To the extent that is not possible,
then our gas quality team must make a determination whether the gas must be
shut-in immediately, or whether a waiver can be granted, based on numerous
factors which would include the type of diluent out of spec, the cause and
duration of the problem, and the plan customers have to correct the problem.


It is important that Northern Natural comply with the provisions set in the
EPNG Tariff.  If you have any questions please let me know.

Sincerely,

Due to the additional activity within ETS and the holidays, we will not hold a GISB Update meeting during the remainder of this year.  Hopefully we'll get back on a schedule after the first of the year.  Below is my update on a few GISB matters.  We'll go into more detail at our next meeting.

ENERGY INDUSTRY STANDARDS BOARD (EISB)
The GISB Board of Directors has approved revisions to GISB's Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws to incorporate language necessary to transition to the new organization, which will address standards for wholesale and retail gas and electric transactions.  The new organization, which goes into effect January 1, 2002, will be named the North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB).  The wholesale gas quadrant, which is now GISB, should continue with business as usual.  In January, I'll give a more detailed update on the workings of NAESB.

GISB REPRESENTATON
Stan Horton's term on the GISB Board of Directors expires December 31, 2001.  Shelley Corman will take his place on the Board.  Her term expires December 31, 2003.
My term as a representative on GISB's Executive Committee expires December 31, 2003.

ORDER 637 TRANSACTIONAL REPORTING
The development of the new transactional reporting datasets for use on EBBs is almost complete.  The EBB implementation should be included in the next publication, which is scheduled for July 31, 2002.  This is probably a firm date.  The EDI implementation is now a lower priority, but will still be developed.

GISB VERSION 1.5 STANDARDS AND ERRATA
Two separate errata have been developed for the version 1.5 standards.  The errors in the standards books are extensive.  The errata are posted alongside the books on the GISB homepage and have been distributed internally to all who received standards books.  I am working to have GISB correct the standards books.  Some people want to hold off and incorporate the corrections into the next version.  Our implementation will be much smoother if we don't have to continually refer to the errata along with the standards books.  I'll let you know what is decided.


Thanks,
Theresa"

Joe,

As discussed, please repath January 2001 for contract 101559.  I have input the rates on the invoice that Jeff Nielsen said he agreed to.  However, there are certain paths for the same period of time that Oneok indicated different rates for each.  They should be consistent so I input one rate for all paths on a Mid to Mid basis.  Therefore, after you repath the invoice, we will still have a difference.  I want to write-off whatever balance still exists after repathing.  Please prepare the write-off documentation and I will sign.  We need to be sure to do this before we go into next year.  Also, this is the only invoice you have provided me that had issues on this contract which I find hard to believe.   Can you double-check to see that there are no other A/R issues for this IT contract and let me know ASAP.

Thanks!
Vernon"

Subject:	Results of Meeting on Storage Allocation Changes 

The following summarizes the results of our meeting......If you want to discuss further, please call me.

Break Field Area in 3 Regions / Allocate by point
The decision was made to sub-divide the Field Area storage group into two regions; South of Plainview and North of Plainview, rather than 3 regions or allocating by point. If it is determined that additional divisions are necessary in the future, such changes can be made at that time. Changes  to CAS are required. I have discussed the changes with Bob Johnson and Doug Aschwege and have learned that the changes are not difficult to make and could be made in a couple days. 
Gary Spraggins and I will determine which deferred delivery points are in these new field regions and then provide the information to Bob and Doug. 
 
Question:  Should this change be implemented immediately or should it wait until the beginning of the withdrawal season?
 
Change from 'net zero' approach / Provide minimum level of activity
The decision was made to table this concern for now. The scheduled activity that drives the allocation process does not guarantee physical pipeline operations. In most cases, the flexibility provided by the Cunningham Field allows Gas Control to adjust operations to maintain the required minimum level of injections/withdrawals into Redfield and Lyons. Further analysis is required. Steve Thomas, Larry Swett and I will continue to monitor the system conditions/operations that effect physical storage to determine if and what additional changes maybe warranted. 

Send ""Notice"" when final scheduled number exceeds operational capacity
The IT group will modify the scheduling cycle to add a procedure where the final net scheduled storage quantity is compared to the operational capacity set for storage. If the final scheduled quantity exceeds operational capacity, I will receive a notification via e-mail. The purpose here is to monitor occurrences to determine the magnitude of the problem. I will get with Gerry Medeles to finalize the matter.

FYI -  Elizabeth forwarded the letter attached below to the ENA contacts listed along with a courtesy copy to Citizens.  The amount of the reservation payments that are outstanding and will revert back to Citizens is $205,755.  Citizens recalled this capacity on 11/30/2001 and will pay TW directly for December business.

Lincoln Electric System (LES) would like us to set out in writing what a delivery point operator is.  LES is constructing and owning a new TBS (LES TBS #1) to their new power plant near Lincoln.  Apparently, having a letter setting this out is very important to them.  Dari has developed the attached letter and wanted to run it by you all for your approval.  Please let me know as soon as possible if you have any issues with the letter.  Thanks!

We just want to reinterate that we will not be paying anyone until our Commodity due date.  For instance, if the invoices that you sent out at Commodity time add up to a credit,  we will not pay them until the due date that we have on those invoices and so for this month, since our due date is a day that is an Enron Holiday (December 24), we will not be paying anyone until December 26.  I know that in the past we may have paid the shippers early but our policy has always really been to not pay them until the due date.  We will want to do this from now on unless your have a special circumstance.  If you have any questions, please let us know.

Thanks,

Raetta

Effective immediately, we will be taking all wire and check requests to Rick Dietz to be put in line for payment after Lynn has signed them. We will have a drop box in my office for these and they will need to get down to him 2 days before you want the wire or check to go out. If you have any questions, please let me know.

Beverly was given administrative rights, since she worked from home and that is why she has not experienced any problems. But, the rest of the team has experienced  some of the same issue you guys have. Kathy Royal with El Paso has their IT person working with Jean McFarland on our side to try and resolve these issue by the Jan. 6th deadline. If you have further questions or concerns, please ask. Thank you.

Subject:	FW: Request Submitted: Access Request 000000000078904

John & Terry,

My understanding is this request was to allow the changes EPNG might institute to be automatically accessed without our losing our ability to nominate in the new Passport system.  In the past, when EPNG institutes updates (I seem to recall the phrase, ""changing the Java script""), we are unable to access Passport 2000.  I also understand efforts are underway to get this worked out with EPNG ""IT"" without our being given administrative access.  Scott had advised IT around the first of November that the old Passport would be suspended.

EPNG has extended the date to January 6th for the old Passport system to be suspended.  After that time, until whatever is worked out between the IT groups, when the EPNG updates occur, we will be unable to electronically confirm.  I would be interested in knowing how this has affected TWPL.  I had understood Beverly encountered no difficulties at any time.

Your help would be greatly appreciated.

The meeting yesterday with about 7 small producers in Okla went fairly well.  It is obvious that they now realize that the cost of processing, if necessary is there obligation, not Northerns.
We heard the same rhetoric about the history, for the past 30 years it is has been a ""wet"" system and they entered into contracts without any processing obligations.  Northern' can't change due to this and historical operation and ""unwaive"" the high c6+ based on the highest receipt levels.  They (Dan?? ) was very insistent that if a problem occurred, all shippers should be pro rated and NNG's tariff should be enforced at the tailgate of the Bushton plant, not the point of receipt as the tariff currently states.  They asked us to file to change, potentially incorporate a default processing agreement that had to be used in the event of high concentrations of C6+--  I think you get the drift of the discussions--  don't just cut my gas, cut everyone
 
 
To Do's
We agreed to look at data from last year (assuming we have it available) to determine what the allocations would have been under the following scenarios:
        a)  Allocation as proposed-  highest levels
        b)  Allocation based on prorata at Bushton outlet
        c)  Allocation based on prorata at Demarc
 
Greg is to get in contact with Mitch Hertz (their attorney) to discuss feasibility of requiring gas quality waiver at the tailgate of Bushton:
          what FERC would do--
          what about other shippers--
          what is Bushton isn't running
          what about a default processing agreement being required
          Hypothetical allocations above, can FERC require
 
Dari,  can you find the status and outcome of a Southern docket filed last year?
 
Mary D.  validate that we can't require the plant to run--
 
Mike Loeffler-  check Oklahoma state proceeding to find any filing by Energex and Transok relating to gas being ""dry""  may not yet be filed---   need to watch for it
 
Timing---  we said we would attempt to get back to them mid January--  
 
If you have any questions, please feel free to call myself or Dave N.

Per our discussions yesterday, I did find an Iroquois Gas Transmission System, L.P. Order On Rehearing in my file, dated August 5, 1997 in Docket No. RP97-126-002 (80 FERC P61,199) concerning scheduling alt FT by price.  On reviewing it again, some key points were:  

	Allocate based on the highest percentage of the maximum rate - the rate used being the rate for the package of services that includes those secondary rights.
	The Commission maintains that all firm capacity, once scheduled, be curtailed pro rata, without regard to price.

Panhandle also filed on March 14, 1997 for scheduling alt FT by price at Docket No. RP97-291 (it's referenced in footnotes, but I don't have a copy of the filing)."

Attached is an excel spreadsheet showing the gas quality at all the points in the Bushton Universe.  I have sorted the information by POI #, BTU content, carbon dioxide content, helium content, C6+ content and nitrogen content.  The POI listing is consistent with the official Bushton Universe list used for Gas Logistics purposes with the following exceptions:

	1. POIs # 71315 and # 71316 are not on the attached list since they are pooling points and will not have gas composition information.
	2. POI # 59685 Richfield Gas Storage/NNG Stevens is on the attached list twice.  The gas composition information is tied to meter # 658429 and the throughput activity is reported by the summation meter # 660018.
	3. POI # 1309 CNG/Beaver  - C Line Receipt is including in the attached data since the CNG Beaver processing plant is not running at this time.  The CNG volume is flowing to the Bushton Plant as strangers gas.  

Once everyone has gotten a chance to look at this information I would like to have another meeting to discuss the data.  A video conference has been set as follows:

	Day			Thursday
	Date			January 3, 2002
	Time			1:30 to 3:00 pm
	Location		42C2 Houston and 696 Omaha

Feel free to give me a call if you have questions.

I agree with Lynn's comments with one exception. My understanding is that P=
GAS was to be simply a vehicle to provide the end user volumes to Gas Logis=
tics, in addition to the TBS volumes, as is current practice. We want to pu=
rsue having these volumes supplied to Measurement  via email so that they c=
an be imported electronically. Again, these are not  OMVs in the traditiona=
l sense, since custody transfer has occurred on the TBS volumes. There is c=
urrently no mechanism in place to compare the TBS volumes to the end user v=
olumes other than manually. Additionally, due to the time of the month that=
 these numbers are received, I'm not sure that there is sufficient time to =
argue the accuracy of the numbers . Currently, paragraph 4. of the End User=
 agreement states ""The Shipper's transportation agreement will be billed on=
 the actual measured takes at the End User's POI."" It does not address any =
differences between the TBS volumes, positive or negative, other than Shipp=
er is responsible for any imbalances resulting from the measured volumes at=
 the End User POI. There are no provisions to challenge the accuracy of the=
 numbers being supplied. Lynn is probably right that we will need some  add=
itional discussions on this.
Thanks-
Gary

Subject:=09RE: End-user Agreement Processes

=09I would like to recap my understanding and the ""To Do's"" from the meetin=
g yesterday. =20

=09=091.  After November 1, Measurement would NO longer adjust any TBS phys=
ical
=09                 volumes unless there was a PPA directly influencing sai=
d TBS.

=09=092.  Measurement would check  to see if they had a deduct meter they w=
ere
=09                 using in the end user process. (Since the meeting we ha=
ve discovered that
=09 =09     the deduct meter IS in GVA, therefore no checking needs to be d=
one).

=09=093.  Gas Logistics would check with IT on possible enhancement (if nec=
essary) for
=09=09     negative volumes to the TBS.  (We have talked with IT and this w=
ould be
=09=09     a major enhancement and have to be done with the new system).

=09=094.  Procedures need to be documented to handle negative numbers creat=
ed by
=09=09     the LDC giving measurement an end user actual volume greater tha=
n the=20
=09=09     TBS connected to NNG.

=09=095.  Measurement and Gas Logistics agreed that all measured volumes in=
cluding
=09=09     End User point volumes would be ""housed' in PGAS.

=09After further discussions in Gas Logistics, our recommendation is that n=
either Measurement or Gas Logistics accomodate a
=09negative number.  If the LDC gives measurement an end user volume greate=
r than the TBS the following should happen:

=09=091.  Measurement should either:

=09=09=09a.  Call the LDC and let them know they cannot accept a volume at =
an end
=09=09=09     user point higher than their TBS.

=09=09=09b.  Or Measurement can call Jodie Floyd on the Gas Logistics Measu=
rement Desk
=09=09=09     and Jodie will call LDC with the same info.

=09=092.  If Measurement does not get an answer before measurement close, t=
hen measurement will
=09=09     use the number equal to the TBS for the end user point.

=09Gary and Ellis, you may want to have more discussions on this topic.  I =
would be glad to regroup if you want.
=09I have put a call into Marketing to talk to them about our concerns on t=
his issue.  Also Raetta and Jodie are
=09 going to go ahead and call Wisconsin Gas and get their explanation of w=
hy an end user point would be
=09greater than the TBS.  Hopefully it is just a measurement error.  We wil=
l let you know the outcome.

=09If there is something I missed, please let me know.  Thanks. Lynn

 Have we run into any additional obstacles?  Do you need me to do anything =
to assist in the process?  If something does change, would you please let m=

I just spoke to Terry regarding the September dispute.  He is willing to spilt the difference if we can come up with an appropriate letter agreement .  He would like us to draft a letter stating that both parties are agreeing to a negotiated volume/dollar amount.  The language should state that both parties are not setting a precedence and are not waiving any existing rights.  The volume/dollar amount is not based on anything specific.  Please do not send dispute notice response.  I believe that we will have a deal.

He is also mentioned that we should see their response to the test protocol tomorrow.

They received the CO2 response and it was what he expected.  They are currently claiming Force Majuere on their Praxair contract, but have not been sued yet. They were pleased with the fact that we are posting a quality reminder and are feeling better about their chances of a commercial solution with CIG.

They are also planning to send us some kind of communication (demand letter) on EPPI.  

Sorry for the abbreviated note.  If you have questions, call me.

The meeting yesterday with about 7 small producers in Okla went fairly well.  It is obvious that they now realize that the cost of processing, if necessary is there obligation, not Northerns.
We heard the same rhetoric about the history, for the past 30 years it is has been a ""wet"" system and they entered into contracts without any processing obligations.  Northern' can't change due to this and historical operation and ""unwaive"" the high c6+ based on the highest receipt levels.  They (Dan?? ) was very insistent that if a problem occurred, all shippers should be pro rated and NNG's tariff should be enforced at the tailgate of the Bushton plant, not the point of receipt as the tariff currently states.  They asked us to file to change, potentially incorporate a default processing agreement that had to be used in the event of high concentrations of C6+--  I think you get the drift of the discussions--  don't just cut my gas, cut everyone
 
 
To Do's
We agreed to look at data from last year (assuming we have it available) to determine what the allocations would have been under the following scenarios:
        a)  Allocation as proposed-  highest levels
        b)  Allocation based on prorata at Bushton outlet
        c)  Allocation based on prorata at Demarc
 
Greg is to get in contact with Mitch Hertz (their attorney) to discuss feasibility of requiring gas quality waiver at the tailgate of Bushton:
          what FERC would do--
          what about other shippers--
          what is Bushton isn't running
          what about a default processing agreement being required
          Hypothetical allocations above, can FERC require
 
Dari,  can you find the status and outcome of a Southern docket filed last year?
 
Mary D.  validate that we can't require the plant to run--
 
Mike Loeffler-  check Oklahoma state proceeding to find any filing by Energex and Transok relating to gas being ""dry""  may not yet be filed---   need to watch for it
 
Timing---  we said we would attempt to get back to them mid January--  
 
If you have any questions, please feel free to call myself or Dave N.

Subject: Producer meeting


The meeting yesterday with about 7 small producers in Okla went fairly well.  It is obvious that they now realize that the cost of processing, if necessary is there obligation, not Northerns.
We heard the same rhetoric about the history, for the past 30 years it is has been a ""wet"" system and they entered into contracts without any processing obligations.  Northern' can't change due to this and historical operation and ""unwaive"" the high c6+ based on the highest receipt levels.  They (Dan?? ) was very insistent that if a problem occurred, all shippers should be pro rated and NNG's tariff should be enforced at the tailgate of the Bushton plant, not the point of receipt as the tariff currently states.  They asked us to file to change, potentially incorporate a default processing agreement that had to be used in the event of high concentrations of C6+--  I think you get the drift of the discussions--  don't just cut my gas, cut everyone
 
 
To Do's
We agreed to look at data from last year (assuming we have it available) to determine what the allocations would have been under the following scenarios:
        a)  Allocation as proposed-  highest levels
        b)  Allocation based on prorata at Bushton outlet
        c)  Allocation based on prorata at Demarc
 
Greg is to get in contact with Mitch Hertz (their attorney) to discuss feasibility of requiring gas quality waiver at the tailgate of Bushton:
          what FERC would do--
          what about other shippers--
          what is Bushton isn't running
          what about a default processing agreement being required
          Hypothetical allocations above, can FERC require
 
Dari,  can you find the status and outcome of a Southern docket filed last year?
 
Mary D.  validate that we can't require the plant to run--
 
Mike Loeffler-  check Oklahoma state proceeding to find any filing by Energex and Transok relating to gas being ""dry""  may not yet be filed---   need to watch for it
 
Timing---  we said we would attempt to get back to them mid January--  
 
If you have any questions, please feel free to call myself or Dave N.

	We have reviewed the assignments Jean sent out earlier in the week.  At this time
	I think the split is OK.  I would like for you to put in writing for me the following:

	 	Who is your back up on critical reports, etc when you are out.
		I would like for that back up to be someone that was NOT on
		your original team.  This may help us address the issue of the two
		""old"" teams merging.

		For example I am assuming if one rep has the shipper business and another rep has the
		operator business for the same company, then those two reps should back each other's
		desk.

		Randy Janzen is backing up Jean Adams desk on Lamar Power Plant since he has AEP which
			is shipper that does business at the Lamar Plant.

		Scott and Kathy support each other's desk since Kathy has ElPaso as a Shipper and
			Scott has ElPaso as Operator.

		Harry and Joe support each other on Oneok since Harry has Bushton and Joe has the
			gathering

		The areas of concern in relation to day to day business are below and need specific back up
		reps. 

			GPM Monthly Pricing Report
			Lamar Power Plant True Ups
			PVR Report
			Oneok Gathering Reporting
			NNG Administrative Contracts
			SPS Power Plant True Up
			Conoco Power Plant True Up
			MOPS Daily Report
				
		The HIgh profile shippers/Operators that need specific back ups are as follows:

			Duke/GPM
			Oneok
			Transcanada
			Dynegy
			Reliant
			ElPaso
			West Texas Gas 

	If there is any confusion with the email, please do not hesitate to call Terry or myself.  Thanks. Lynn

It is possible to filter ""our"" critical messages from our applications and allow them to be sent externally.  I will continue to work with the messaging team to put together guidelines to address our requirements and issues.   

I believe that each type of emergency will define some of our options.  For example in this weeks virus, messages from applications would not spread the virus.  This virus was spread if you clicked the link (X rated)--at that point everyone in your ""sent"" log would get the message, sometimes many messages.  We may have still blocked incoming messages on this emergency, but outgoing from applications wouldn't impacted others.  Pointing to Omaha in this case would not have worked.

I will keep everyone posted on the status as I move forward with the messaging team.

If you have any questions, please call.   Thanks.  Jean 713-859-6238

Subject:	Outbound TMS Messages

With yesterday's e-mail outage behind us, I think we need to investigate the ability to keep outbound TMS messages and Critical Notices flowing during these periods of virus infiltration.  TMS generates cut notices after each scheduling cycle and with extended outages of mailman.enron.com, we are losing a critical channel of communication to customers.  Customers rely on these messages to inform them of business changes.  In addition, ETS critical notices generated by X-12 cannot be sent out during these periods.  They are called ""critical notices"" because of the immediacy of when a customer needs to react.   

I do think we need to know the following:  

1.  Could a message generated by TMS cause further infection of the e-mail systems?
2.  Can the critical notices cause further infection of Enron's e-mail systems?    
3.  Is it possible to keep outbound messages from systems other than Exchange flowing during virus interruptions?  

This is a significant reliability issue and ETS customer communications were disrupted for approximately 8 hours yesterday.  Please let me know how we should proceed.

	Sue, we have looked at an automated way to take care of this issue.  So far we have not
	found an exceptable change.   It is a timing issue with true ups from the previous day
	which are not completed before the current day calcuations are done.  It is an item we 
	are manually monitoring today, but we are continuing to look for a better method.
	Thanks.  Lynn

Yes. I have been monitoring BP's FDD balance. Sherry and Chris have been working with someone at BP, filling in for the regular vacationing BP scheduler, and who is unfamiliar with FDD service. Chris and Sherry have taken the over scheduled FDD and rescheduled it into BP's IDD account. Currently BP's FDD is within contract parameters and I will continue to monitor all FDD balances.

Can you please check into BP Canada injecting more than their FDD contract quantity.  What can be done now.  What processes do we need to put in place to prevent that from happening in the future?

Thanks,

Attached is the latest FDD status report as of December 19th.

Tabs showing FDD activity for this time period for the last three years is also included.


The GIP contracts should be at 89.90% to be on target to get to the max allowable contract quantity for the end of December.  The max target amount for GIP accounts by the end of December is 83.5%.  The average remaining balance for all GIP contracts is 95%.  To get to the tariff limit of 83.5% by Jan 1st, the GIP contracts will have to withdrawal about 1.8 Bcf, or 150 mmcfd, over the next 12 days.

The 3-step & 4-step do not have a minimum requirement to be met by the end of December since minimum withdrawals for Nov/Dec is zero.

The last report stated that Entergy-Koch had switched to GIP from 4-step.  This was in error.  They are still in the 4-step process.

BP Canada has injected 101.16% of their contract amount.  They have 2,125,406 of GIP on a contract of 2,100,932.

The percentage break out by service is GIP - 34.5%, 4-Step - 45.9%, and 3-Step - 19.5%.

Overall FDD is 94.36% full.

If you have any questions, please call me.

No, I do not want the ENA contract hit with these flows.  We effectively shut them down on the 3rd.  Between then and 12/20, I want to look at other options.  I left Steve Kirk a message and he replied that he is out through Jan 2.  He suggested talking with Dari today regarding other options.  I'll let you know once I do.

Thanks!

Yes, we were successful in getting a transporter to step in.  This starts tomorrow - however I am in talks with regulatory on what to do on the days between 12/3 - 12/20.  Also, we are not going to grant an OBA at this point at this time.

Thanks!

Vernon, 
Warrior Gas Company contact is Robert C. (Bob) Lyon - phone 915-688-3838

John Wollaston with Embassy is requesting that you send him a pro forma OBA for his review - his e-mail is: embassy9@home.com

Vernon, Embassy is getting lined out for January business.  They just got caught in the middle of the ENA fallout, but they are anxious to get a resolution for December in place.  Thanks for your help.

The volumes were scheduled for the 1st and 2nd only, then the nomination was removed and scheduled to 0. The point continues to flow without a nom or scheduled volume.

Have a phone number or contact at Warrior?  

Also, we will need to talk about what has transpired between the 3rd and now.  Jean told me yesterday that even though there is no nom we are scheduling and delivering gas to this POI under a dead contract (ENA's).   We should not be doing this.  This will cause DDVC penalties et al.  Until we have a contract for transport with someone - we shouldn't just flow gas.

John,  After we spoke this afternoon I had another call from John Wollaston @ Embassy Natural Gas.  He spoke with Warrior Gas, a Clayton Williams company, which is the gas supplier and they are willing to assume the responsibility for the transport at POI 4879.  Let me know how to proceed, if this is a viable option. Do we want to set up a contract with Warrior Gas?  Do we want to establish and OBA for this point with Embassy - Mr. Wollaston mentioned the OBA possibility.  The deal with Sid Richardson is probably not going to happen.

I couldn't find a contract for Warrior or Clayton Williams on NNG.

Let's talk tomorrow.

Thanks,
Jean

Thanks for the contact. I have passed this on to Vernon Mercaldo to see what interest they might have in holding their own upstream transportation.

Mike,

Embassy Natural Gas is the operator for POI 4879 - Vantage Plainview.  John Wollaston is the contact 915-685-4103.  Embassy purchased gas from ENA (2,500 dth/day) to service Azteca Milling, LP - This is a $250 million  plant that mills flour for tortillas - one of the largest employers in Midland, TX.  

ENA was transporting the gas on their contract for Embassy.  They had a hedging deal : TOK index plus 15cents ($2.08 + .15) - present day ($2.95).  He is concerned that he will have to go out and pay more $ for gas.  I  put him in touch with Kevin Brady (3-7750) with ENA and Kevin gave him the marketer Jason Williams (3-1929) to contact about Embassy getting in touch with the upstream supplier for ENA so that they could perhaps buy the gas directly and hopefully at the same price.

I don't know the outcome of their conversation.

I thought your group might be able to help him.  I have not mentioned this possiblilty to him.  Would you let me know if you plan to pursue?

Call me if you have questions.

Jean

Lynn/Rick, Frank sent this to me last week and I have been working on it but I have one item for $1,406.01 that was listed on a report that Frank had that I can't seem to find on the A/R - maybe Alice can help me find it.  After I find that entry, I was going to get it to Jean Blair to get the writeoff forms written up.

Let's meet sometime this morning (if you are in) and allow me to catch you up on an a/r discussion that I had with Dave Neubauer last week regarding the clean up of our older receivables.  I will be meeting with Lynn from 9:00 - 10:00 so possibly we can meet right after that.  We'll give stop by and let you know.

	We finally found the right person in the KN Energy organization for the 18 dth Carlton Obligation.

	KN will nominate today for Gas Day 26th going forward.  We told KN that they will have a penalty
	of $25.00 per dth for each day they did not nominate.  18 dth x 25.00 = $450/day x 3 days = $1350.

	We also told them we have been leaving messages since Saturday.  We left messages at 
	3 different offices.  KN admitted to seeing the posting but ""did not understand"" the obligation
	and they did not call for clarification.

	If you have any questions, please let John (Ext. 7429) or I (Ext. 7637) know.  Thanks. Lynn

Per my e-mail below, I am forwarding a draft of the letter to RER regarding the DDVC/SMS issue.  Please review the letter and provide any comments or concerns.  Bill is going to be in Minneapolis (at this point anyway) Tuesday through Friday of next week so I'd like to have it completed by the end of next week in order to be prepared to discuss the issue when RER.

Hey guys,

Bill talked with RER regarding this issue last week and committed to get a letter to them articulating our position with supporting provisions of the tariff.  Based on that conversation, the scheduled meeting was cancelled.  Moreover, he is reviewing RER's original dispute letter from March and we can determine course of action thereafter.

Dari - Did you receive my e-mail of late which had a few questions regarding Section 8 of the tariff? 

Thanks for your help and patience,
Vicki

	It was my understanding that Bill Fowler was going to meet with RER last week to discuss this matter.  Northern continues to stand firm on our interpretation of the tariff requirements regarding payment but marketing is to determine when and whether we will send a demand letter to RER.  We are waiting for marketing regarding how we will proceed.  Thanks MW

 Just a follow up on this issue. Most of the October PPAs have been processed with a few exceptions. Hopefully, all will be complete at the end of this week. We are still working on finding a way to systematically identify the late charts. I'll keep you advised of the progress on that front.
 Have a safe holiday !

All of the MidAmerican corrections for October have been made with the exception of 0737181-01,0737021-01, & 0737021-02. The charts were never received form these locations. Dan Boswell has been out of the office due to his Father's death but should be back tomorrow. We'll get a handle on the other outstanding PPAs this week.

	Gary and Caroline, as of today, we have emailed a list by station (7 and/or 16 day charts) to the measurement
	group which needs to be read for PPA's to correct the daily volumes fro the following shippers:

		MidAmerican - 147 stations (It is my understanding you have already 44 of the 147)
		IES - 87 stations
		Interstate Power - 6 stations
		Wisconsin Power and Light - 11 stations

	In order for Gas Logistics to keep track of the ones that need to be corrected, we would like for Measurement to send 
	us updates on the following information ASAP:

		1.  Which station numbers have or have not been corrected for October.

		2.  How many October charts have been received and how many are outstanding

		3.  Provide status of November chart information.

	Gas Logistics needs the October corrections in the system by December 19th, which is the time
	frame for the first prior period run.  This is important for us to be able to review the prior period invoices.
	As you 	find there are missing charts, if we can be of assistance in calling the field, please let us know. 
	This way, the measurement group can concentrate on reading the charts.

	We appreciate your assistance and help in tracking these prior periods and helping each of us to keep focused
	to get these prior period corrections done by the next months billing.  If you have any questions, please let
	Rick or I know.  Thanks. Lynn

Based on this,  I assume the memo is being changed to say that ""the agreed upon measurement volume for the period is 567,546.5.""  I'm ok with the letter-  
Do we need to send the dispute resolution letter as a precaution in case Oneok wants to change this settlement.  Or should we have them send us confirmation that the dispute response is suspended pending final resolution of this agreement.  MK

		Charlie sent me the following message.
		""If the intent is to calculate the average between the two sets of numbers (NNG's vs ONEOK's) the ""settlement number"" would be 567,546.5!""
		As the settlement document states that the blank number is what we are going to use for ""PTR"", I think Charlie is correct.  His number takes the average between the Plant PTR calculation and Northern's number.

FYI - 

In case you have not yet heard... Richardson Products has not paid their $1,661,000 TW line pack sales invoice.  They are claiming to have a Global Netting Agreement with Enron and are netting this payment with ENA and EGL issues.  We asked for a copy of this agreement even though we are certain that TW is not a party to it.

Paul Cherry, TK, Steve Kleb and I are all following up with our counterparts and are giving the collection of this money top priority.  We will keep you informed.

Subject:	Communication Alternatives in Crisis/Disaster/Outage Situations

In Shelley's staff meeting this morning, she expressed concern about situations (like the one we are currently experiencing) in regard to e-mail and electronic communication channel availability to customers.  Unfortunately, much of the last 24 hour's issues have been driven by poor and incomplete information coming from the corporate team.  In addition, we have suffered our own internal communication challenges.  With that said, she identified two critical areas that she wants to resolve in the short term;  

1.)  An efficient e-mail distribution capability that is not dependent on Enron firewall access.  Although messages were successfully sent to customers yesterday, the process was cumbersome and time consuming.  A process that can handle the complete distribution list and/or segmentation of messages (ie by pipeline) is needed.  The service should be available from remote locations.  I am currently investigating this issue.  (i.e. bulk mail handler and reliability via outside ISP source.) 

2.)  A communication diagnostic tool that is not dependent on corporate team information.  There should be the ability to test our communication abilities/processes to external parties.  The tool should address what customers can access, whether they can receive messages, etc.  Again it should have remote capabilities. 

I would characterize the goals of addressing these issues to be that ETS knows what its current electronic communication situation is and that it is accurately communicating it to customers.  

Alma will set up a meeting to discuss ASAP.  Alma, please invite those on the ""To"" distribution.

Hey guys,

Bill talked with RER regarding this issue last week and committed to get a letter to them articulating our position with supporting provisions of the tariff.  Based on that conversation, the scheduled meeting was cancelled.  Moreover, he is reviewing RER's original dispute letter from March and we can determine course of action thereafter.

Dari - Did you receive my e-mail of late which had a few questions regarding Section 8 of the tariff? 

Thanks for your help and patience,
Vicki

	It was my understanding that Bill Fowler was going to meet with RER last week to discuss this matter.  Northern continues to stand firm on our interpretation of the tariff requirements regarding payment but marketing is to determine when and whether we will send a demand letter to RER.  We are waiting for marketing regarding how we will proceed.  Thanks MW

	In talking with Fran we need to have Written Reviews to HR by COB January 2, 2002.  The reviews
	do not need to be signed by either party.  We can start communicating reviews to the employees
	at any time.  But there should be no discussion on bonus or merit until they are finalized on or
	around January 18.  Thanks. Lynn

Subject:	Performance Evaluation due dates

Let me clarify a point about the Performance Evaluation due dates:

The written reviews are due in HR by January 2 (not signed off by employee)

You ARE NOT required to have completed all your employee review meetings by January 2

You can start discussions as soon as you have completed the reviews, but the discussion should focus around performance.

No variable pay or merit discussions should take place in the performance review meeting.  Those will take place on or around January 18.

Please call with any questions.

Thanks and have a great holiday!

Lynn,

Koch is the agent for IES nominations.

On the accounting side, IES pays their own invoices.  WP&L, Interstate Power, IEA and IES are all under Alliant, but they operate independently.

Kathy Washington currently handles the scheduling for IES since she handles Koch, and also IES accounting since they pay their own invoices.  However, each month Kathy Washington gives the IES invoices to Jean to include with Alliant's mailout.

Hope this explains everything!

Give me a call if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Renee   J

Hi Vernon!

Karen is out for the rest of the year.  She and I only worked one day together in the past couple of weeks, but I think she mentioned that she had talked to you about 3 A/R lines listed under her name that she thought were your companies----they aren't ones we work with.  The data is:


LAGERSTROM, KAREN	BENNINGFIELD, ROBERT	UNION PACIFIC FUELS, INC.	TPPA98084012	COM	1-Jan-99	24-Sep-98		13,342.90

LAGERSTROM, KAREN	LINHART, JOE	ONEOK ENERGY MARKETING AND TRADING T17901014021	COM	12-Feb-01	22-Feb-01		35,163.87 		

Just wanted to make sure you are aware of these and confirm that they are companies you work with.  Karen sent a note to Robert Benningfield asking for a status report for everything showing under her, and she included these.  If I don't hear from Robert, I'll call him on Monday.  

Thanks,

	John and Terry, could you check into having a Business Objects report done for all groupings with
	the following information.


		Previous Cyclce Nomination	Current Nomination	Confirmation	Schedule

	Confirmation piece is not critical if that prolongs getting the report.

	The reason for the report  - Gas Control needs to know what changes have taken place and
	this will prevent the teams from doing a manual report.

	If we already have access to something similar to this, let me know.  I would like to be
	able run this report during cycle.  (I think I am probably asking for the moon), but that
	would be the best time for Gas Control.

	Thanks. Lynn"

Lynn,
After preparing the Storage Summary Sheet this morning I could not save the updated file. In fact the file has disappeared from this solar system. I contacted the Solution Center to have the file restored and was informed that a business reason and director level approval is required before any restoration work can begin. 
As for the business reason, as you know, the NNG Marketing Dept uses this sheet daily to monitor storage activity and as a basis for purchase and sales decisions throughout the month. Marketing expects to see this sheet daily. In addition, Finance has requested a copy of the file daily to help track potential imbalance activity on NNG's system. 
Lynn, Please forward this e-mail to the Solution Center authorizing the restoration of the file at  \\gthou-dv01\common\mkt\oma\sumdec01.xls so I can continue to support the informational needs of the Marketing and Finance Departments provided by the data in the aforementioned file.
Thanks,
Mike

As part of the TW Negotiated Rate Settlement Hearing, it has been suggested that the following modification to CAS and other associated systems be made:

EBB sytem that allows a shipper interested in capacity to simply enter a receipt and delivery point; the system will automatically let the interested shipper know how much, if any, capacity is available (advantage: although it doesn't provide the IS's the ""last look"" auction their looking for, it at least provides an open process for anybody that is interested to find out if capacity is available (eliminates any claim of ""tortious process""); disadvantage: feasibility and cost are unknown at this time).

This was drafted by an attorney without considerable consultation with Gas Logistics.  

A settlement offer that includes minor tariff changes will be provided to the parties in the proceeding this week.  Although this will buy some time, a scope and cost estimate needs to be determined so that if the modification above is offered, we know what the cost is.    

Alma:  Please schedule a 1 hour meeting with anyone on the distribution and if anyone else should be included, please let Alma know.

Attached is the summary of the Carlsbad/Crawford/WT-1 oba.   The balance as of 11/30/2001 is $1,497,337.92 due Transwestern.
This balance will probably grow by an additional $50,000 due TW in 12/2001.  Please let me know if you desire additional detail.  Hopefully we already reconcile.

 

I will call Sharon Tischer on Wednesday January 2nd to discuss the other balances that exist between TW and DEFSSW - and also the possibility of netting the Hobbs and Artesia payable balances against the Crawford and Waha receivable balances.

Lynn,

I am under the assumption that you are preparing the year-end evaluation on Mike Bodnar. My only input would be to be encouraging on how quickly (and acceptingly) he has caught on to the basics of his new contract administration duties.

	1.  UCU nominated 20,000 dth on their SBA contract

	2.  UCU reduced there Carlton transportation by 10,000 dth

	3.  Kathy is checking all of UCU's contracts to see if overall they:

		a.  Reduced deliveries
		b.  Increased Receipts elsewhere to make up for the Carlton reduction

	We will have an answer by the morning meeting on Wednesday.

	After talking with Robert, we have an Accounts Receivable issue with Oneok for approx. $99,000.
	Rick and Robert have tried to resolve this issue with Oneok, Kinder Morgan and NNG.  We might
	want to consider that this has to be resolved before we agree to an OBA at the point.

	Delaine Kurth with Oneok called today and wanted an OBA at the (Skellytown) Cargray

	After talking with Vernon, I told her that we would draft an OBA on Wednesday with Month

	traps.  She was not excited about the monthly cash out requirement. I told her if we could
	come to agreement we would make it effective 1/1/2002.  If we could not come to agreement,
	we would continue the same methodology as we have today, which is Oneok picks one of the
	transportation contracts at the Cargray tailgate to take any variances.

	Karen, per our conversation, please draft an OBA to send to Oneok.  

	If anyone has any other thoughts or comments on preparing this OBA, please let Karen or

Dave,

We have made good progress on our NNG accounts receivable clean up effort.   We will have a transportation write-off package for you to review later this week.  Our previous observation that most of the outstanding dollars are tied to work orders was correct.  John Cobb and I spoke and he will focus on researching these work orders and will submit a separate write-off package.  My group has prepared some excellent detailed reports that should be useful to John's group.

NNG had EDI problems this morning,  Evidently TMS ran out of disc space cau=
sing all of the files to get hung up in the HUB for the Final cycle and the=
 ID1 cycle. The help desk was paged at 7:35 a.m. to report the problem , To=
by responded, but was having trouble reaching the on call TMS. We did not g=
et a response until 8:55 a.m. from TMS , the EDI files were in the HUB for =
over two hours. Mary Draemer was very helpful and made follow up calls so w=
e could relay an estimated time frame to our customers when this problem wo=
uld be resolved. Monday 12/31/2001 we also experienced printer problems , w=
e were told that a print server was down, the Solution Center was redirecti=
ng print servers on an individual basis at our work stations. Kathy Washing=
ton could not print this morning and had tried to contact someone at the So=
lution Center, and did not receive a response back for quite a while, we we=
nt through the Help desk (Toby) and either he contacted Glen or Glen respon=
ded to the earlier page, We had several technical problems to work through =
this morning, but the most critical problem was trying to reach our support=
 people.

Attached is the report I mentioned, in printed form it shows each discount for each path for each contract.  I will mention this to the TW team now, but go over the report in further detail on the first day of invoicing so each can see the discounts for their own shippers.  Hopefully this will reduce future PPA's.

Here are some thoughs on how we would account for the Offsystem Storage.

Facts
NNG moves 100,000 dts from physical inventory to Offsystem inventory. No accounting entry made to the G/L.
I will look into Form 2 physical reporting changes.

Offsystem inventory is reduced  2,000 dts to reflect in-kind fuel reduction.

Case 1	In-Kind is replaced by simple purchase from 3rd party, NNG incurrs the cost.
Debit 803 (Gas Purchases) or 858 (Fuel exp)		2,000 * cost of gas
	Credit A/P						2,000 * cost of gas

Case 1 books all transactions outside of operational storage.  Reducing the Offsystem storage will cause UAF to increase, however purchasing gas for Operational Storage and not recording it to Operational Storage will offset the UAF increase.


Case 2	In-kind is replaced by Operational Storage, NNG incurrs the cost
Debit 816 (Storage Fuel exp)		2,000 * MIP
	Credit 812 (Storage Fuel Credit)		2,000 * MIP

Debit 808 (Storage Withdrawal)		2,000 * MIP
	Credit 1174 (Encroachment)		2,000 * MIP

Case 3	In-kind is replaced by Operational Storage, Tracker incurrs the cost
Debit 816 (Storage Fuel exp)		2,000 * MIP
	Credit 812 (Storage Fuel Credit)		2,000 * MIP

Debit 808 (Storage Withdrawal)		2,000 * MIP
	Credit 1174 (Encroachment)		2,000 * MIP
	
Debit 1823 (Storage Fuel Tracker)	2,000 * MIP
	Credit 805 (Storage Fuel Recovery)	2,000 * MIP

Enron's Bonds Tell the Tale: Stay Away
By Herb Greenberg <<mailto:hgreenberg@thestreet.com>>
Senior Columnist
RealMoney.com
10/24/2001 03:40 PM EDT
URL: <<http://www.thestreet.com/p/rmoney/herbonthestreet-rm/10002953.html>>

Updated from 2:47 p.m. EDT 
If you ever have questions about whether a battered stock is cheap, check out its bonds. Bond analysts almost always know best because they're looking at the guts of a company -- the ability of a company to service its debt. If it can't service the debt, stockholders are at a greater risk of getting pummeled because debtholders always come before stockholders when it comes to getting paid. 
Which brings us to Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) . The only reason to mention it is that some analysts are really reiterating buys based on its low multiple. (Low, fellas, is relative to reality!) Cramer today talks about his hunch that the stock is vulnerable because, as he says, ""accounting irregularities = sell."" 
Good point. Now let's back that up with the bond market's view, which can be seen in the so-called ""swap spread,"" which is bond-traderspeak for the spread between the LIBOR interest rate and the interest rate for comparable paper, or swaps. It's a benchmark bond traders use to determine risk. Tuesday, that spread on Enron's five-year notes was 650 basis points, or about 6.5 percentage points. Today, it's 1,000 points, or 10 percentage points. As one bond trader told me today, anybody would be crazy to pay that much. Another bond trader told another friend the same thing. 
Why? As of June 30, Enron had cash of just $847 million and debt of nearly $13 billion. 
And this observation: Those five-year notes currently yield more than 11%. That's a junk-bond yield for what is still rated as an investment-grade debt; anything more than 9% is considered ultra-high risk. So while you can make 11%, that's still not enough ""where the accounting is questionable,"" one bond trader says. ""You're not being adequately compensated for the fact that the company could default. You have to worry about your recovery value."" 
Not the kind of risk/reward an investor wants to see when the company in question still has a market cap of about $12.5 billion with a capital B. 
Speaking of bonds and stocks: Even with its stock at about $1.16, Global Crossing (GX:NYSE - news - commentary) still has a market cap that exceeds $1 billion. But while its stock has rallied, its bank debt has stayed relatively flat at around 50 cents to 53 cents on the dollar. Similar stories can be told for XO Communications (XOXO:Nasdaq - news - commentary) , with a market cap of about $473 million and bank debt trading at around 52 cents on the dollar; Level 3 Communications (LVLT:Nasdaq - news - commentary) , with a market cap of $1.2 billion and bank debt trading at 66 cents; and McLeodUSA (MCLD:Nasdaq - news - commentary) , with a market cap of $462 million and debt that trades at 53 cents. 
Where are opportunistic bond investors, who should be hopping on such cheap debt -- especially bank debt, which is at the top of the getting-paid-back food chain? They're nowhere to be seen, for the same reasons they're not jumping to buy Enron's bonds: Too much risk, because when companies like those go bad, their assets trade for less than the bonds are currently trading. (Try telling that to ""hope-springs-eternal"" stock investors!) 
Providian pratfalls: Turns out an item here back in May was more fortuitous than it appeared. The item noted how institutional bond investors, who often pony up a slight premium to LIBOR to buy so-called credit default-protection insurance, couldn't find any at any price for Providian (PVN:NYSE - news - commentary) . The insurance is sold by investment banks such as J.P. Morgan Chase and typically involves a complex hedge of stocks and options that requires an investor to take the other side of the trade. If nobody'll take the other side of the trade -- or will charge a ridiculously high price to do so -- investors should beware. Which brings us back to Enron: It is possible to buy credit insurance, but at more than a whopping 1,000 basis points over LIBOR. Hardly a vote of confidence. 


Waiting for the Other Shoe to Drop on Enron

Accounting irregularities = sell. Those three words and an equals sign have always served me well. They remain squarely posted on the base of my quote machine, always in view. They have never let me down. When I have deviated from them I have had to pay severely, as I did when I ignored the accounting irregularities in Cendant (CD:NYSE - news - commentary) initially or when, because of my four-month holding period, I couldn't sell Qwest (Q:NYSE - news - commentary) . 
Which is why I came in with guns blazing on this Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) , telling you to sell it. The stock has now lost half its value and all I can say is, I still can't see why you have to tempt fate and own this one. The notion that the businesses are fundamentally sound, that it has a great core business, is just hokum. Who the heck knows? Who has any idea of what this company can really earn? Who knows what it did earn? 
All I know is that soon the drumbeat will be on from the Democrats that the Justice Department is playing political favorites by not pursuing Enron (noted Republican-giving company) for alleged fraud. 
When that happens, when that shoe drops, wherever Enron is, then maybe it is worth some scrutiny. 
But I bet I still won't like it. 


Enron's Excuses Sound Familiar

If you disclose something that is wrong, and you get accountants to check off that wrong deed, and outside lawyers to check off on that wrong deed, is it therefore right? 
That's what Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) is asking us to believe. By telling us that its ridiculous dealings with the chief financial officer and his private partnership were all sanctioned by outside professionals, they have simply compounded the error. Next they will tell us that Janus, the largest shareholder, knew and wanted those partnerships to generate upside surprises! 
What they are doing at Enron is, well, positively -- here we go -- '80s! In the '80s, you had all of these savings-and-loan jokers pleading that the outside accountants and lawyers checked off on massive chicanery. Somehow it was supposed to make the chicanery kosher. 
Nope. 
What it ended up doing was getting the lawyers and accountants in trouble. The government ended up going after them, too, for abetting the travesties. 
Enron didn't use taxpayers' money, so it is arguably not as clear-cut. But the more we probe this Enron, the more we check it out, the more we know it really stinks and that Jeffrey Skilling didn't leave because the stock got hammered, or some other authentic Wall Street gibberish, but because of this nasty, unseemly situation. 
We don't want an SEC probe here. We want a Justice Department probe. This isn't about unclear disclosure. This could end up being about fraud. 
In the meantime, I wouldn't touch this stock with a 10-foot pole. This one's gonna get real nasty before it gets nice. If it ever does. 

FOOL ON THE HILL 
Enron's Disdain for Investors 
The Motley Fool.com
10/24/01
While recent coverage of Enron centers on the CFO's past partnerships, a smaller -- and more obvious -- omission is what should really make individual investors turn the heat up on this company. Not only does it not release its cash flow statement during each quarter's conference call and press release, something we don't like but is prevalent, it also doesn't release its balance sheet. The company must think we're idiots. They're wrong. 
By Tom Jacobs <<http://www.fool.com/About/staff/tomj.htm>> (TMF Tom9) 
October 24, 2001 
Enron's (NYSE: ENE) <<http://quote.fool.com/uberdata.asp?symbols=ENE>> troubles just don't stop. On Monday, the company announced <<http://www.enron.com/corp/pressroom/releases/2001/ene/70-LJMfinalltr.html>> that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had requested information on ""certain related party transactions <<http://www.fool.com/specials/2001/sp010802e.htm>>."" That was a veiled reference to partnerships until recently organized and directed by Enron CFO Andrew Fastow. There has been a flurry -- a hailstorm -- of financial media attention to this. There are only three possibilities, and none is palatable:
The company's board allowed this deal in order to -- using corporate speak -- ""incentivize"" the CFO, and it was not legal; 
It was legal, but unethical; or 
Enron has been less than forthcoming, perpetuating a pattern of disdain for investors and keeping them in the dark. 
The accounting machinations involve mind-numbing terms and obfuscation, making a simple explanation of what is being alleged above my capacity to provide. The New York Times' Floyd Norris calls them ""some of the most opaque transactions with insiders ever seen."" That leads me to one conclusion when I think about burying myself with the company's SEC filings, accounting texts, my high-speed Web connection, and some beer: that of Shakespeare's King Lear -- ""that way madness lies."" 
On the one hand, I know that pulling all this apart might teach me useful things about accounting, reading financial statements, and finding trouble. (To read what this is all about, check the ""Certain Transactions"" section of the company's latest proxy statement <<http://quote.fool.com/sec/sec.asp?date=03/27/2001&currTicker=ene&symbols=ene&guid=%7B5D0F1D1D%2D5DB7%2D4F4E%2D9BD9%2DFA154603F662%7D>>.) I fully intend to do that -- someday. For now, though, all I need to know about Enron as an investment is that the company has not made these issues transparent.
What's worse, though, is that Enron has made it a habit to keep investors in the dark, and not only about the potentially troublesome CFO issue. The company goes out of its way to hide its true financials. That really cheeses me off.
The quarterly call and press release parade
Most companies hold quarterly conference calls and simultaneously spew press releases (for which the companies pay good money to Business Wire and PR Newswire for dissemination) that allegedly state their latest quarter's numbers and talk about the business. Sometimes, when they have cleaned off their glasses enough for visibility and run it by their lawyers, execs will even venture to speak about the business climate ahead. At least thanks to Regulation Fair Disclosure <<http://www.fool.com/Specials/2001/sp010418.htm>> -- ""Reg. FD"" -- analysts don't get a secret call with the ""real"" numbers at another time than the public. We like that.
Perhaps in a world of pro forma numbers <<http://aol.fool.com/portfolios/rulemaker/2001/rulemaker010815.htm>> and EBITDA <<http://aol.fool.com/portfolios/rulemaker/2001/rulemaker010906.htm>> -- both of which Phil Weiss has skewered appropriately in past columns -- the calls and press releases could never be expected to be that substantive. That makes individual investors increasingly correct to greet such information with cries of ""bullfeathers!"" It only takes a few reviews of earnings press releases to make anyone a skeptic. The PR department carefully dresses them with spin, leaving the details for the fine print. Headline: ""Earnings up!"" (Revenues down 40%.) Headline: ""Revenues up!"" (Earnings down 40%.) The skullduggery of spin and pro forma mangles earnings to meaninglessness <<http://www.fool.com/news/foth/2001/foth010504.htm>>.
At least the conference calls themselves allow you a sense of managers as people and potentially some information about the business, but the financials are not helpful. Why? 
Hiding the cash flow statement
Because almost every company gives up only part of the financial picture at call and press release time. If the income statement is increasingly unhelpful, at least the balance sheet tells you whether the company has increased or decreased cash, right? Well, not quite.
You really need the cash flow statement -- the best measure of how the company's business actually performs. Even then, you may need to make further adjustments <<http://aol.fool.com/portfolios/rulemaker/2001/rulemaker010906.htm>>. Yet the overwhelming majority of companies do not provide the cash flow statement at the call and press release time. 
Check the companies you own. If they don't release cash flow statements with their earnings -- or, at least, prior to SEC filings, you should write and otherwise hound investor relations to push management to do so. Encourage your fellow investors to do so too, and tell the company that The Motley Fool sent ya. They will maintain that the numbers aren't ready at earnings time. Tell them to wait until they are. The numbers are certainly ready in time for the SEC deadline, and wouldn't we be happy to wait a week or two for the complete picture? Or, hey, why not do two releases -- one when the earnings are ready and another for the cash flow? 
If not releasing the cash flow statement were Enron's only sin, it wouldn't be that big a deal. It has plenty of company. But this pre-Halloween < <http://www.fool.com/specials/2001/sp011024.htm>> scary tale gets worse. Unfortunately for Enron investors, the company does the hide-the-cash-flow-statement gig one better.
Hiding the balance sheet
For at least the last three quarters that I checked, Enron hides the balance sheet until SEC filing time. That's right: Not just the cash flow statement, but the balance sheet too. All they release is the income statement -- though, in truth, it does provide pages of income statement information for its many businesses. But why fail to release the balance sheet?
The only conclusion can be that management doesn't want to show its cash balances until it can slip them into SEC filings it thinks people won't bother to read. When questioners on a conference call earlier this year urged former Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling to provide a balance sheet at earnings release, Skilling reportedly ""called the questioner a common vulgarity that surprised many listeners.""
Off his meds that day? Or a symptom of the company's attitude towards shareholders? Looks like the latter: Skilling's gone, but the practice hasn't changed. 
It's about management
We don't depend on management for the numbers during the quarterly public calls and releases. A publicly traded company's financials will appear a few weeks later through its SEC filings available through our Quotes & Data page <<http://quote.fool.com/>>. No investor should be buying -- or holding -- stock in companies if they don't read their filings carefully. It's hard enough to discern what's going on in a business without doing so, and even in those filings -- such as with options grants to management -- the real meat is buried in footnotes. Not reading 10-Qs and 10-Ks is like getting married without dating, or buying a car by paint color only.
What Enron's failure to release this information says is that its management and corporate governance are sub-par. It says management is willing to hold these events, but it'll be darned if it'll present anything meaningful or make it easy for individual investors to find out anything other than management's spin. In Enron's case, its former CEO heaped abuse on someone who dared ask for a change. Does that make Enron's earnings releases circuses? Draw your own conclusion.
Is management listening? Perhaps. It hastily pulled together a conference call yesterday. TMF community member emschulze took notes <<http://boards.fool.com/Message.asp?mid=15974151>>:
""On call, analyst asks why no balance sheet with recent earnings release given company's previous claim that it will work to offer investors greater transparency in measuring its performance... response was that balance sheet doesn't normally come together until the week after its earnings release and that it will be included in 10-Q to be filed by Nov. 14... CEO indicates that it will do a better job of improving timing of release of earnings and balance sheet in future, implying that investors won't have to wait all the way until 10-Q filing deadlines to see balance sheet.""
That's a good sign. But until the company makes an unambiguous commitment to provide the balance sheet at earnings time, Enron should be in the doghouse. 
Good corporate governance means companies release all their quarterly financial statements and discuss them at the same time because today's income statements and pro forma numbers are borderline useless. If it means a delay or a second release to get the numbers together, what's the problem? Shareholders should demand no less. When a company trumpets an income statement, as Enron has, no one should be surprised when smoke appears. And perhaps much more.
Tom Jacobs (TMF Tom9) would like to improve his own cash flow statement. At press time, he owned no shares of Enron.

Bonds Of Troubled Enron Quoted In Dollars, Not Spreads
By Michael C. Barr

10/24/2001
Capital Markets Report
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
Of DOWJONES NEWSWIRES 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The bonds of embattled Enron Corp. (ENE) are trading on a dollar basis and not on a yield margin or spread to Treasurys - another sign of increasing investor skittishness about the once high flying energy trader.
The bonds, which carry investment-grade ratings, ""started trading with a dollar price two days ago,"" said Gary Brown, managing director and head of corporate trading, Wachovia Securities, Charlotte, N.C. 
Bonds are being offered at dollar prices in the high 80's to low 90's, say traders. 
Investment grade bonds typically trade on a spread margin over comparable Treasury issues. ""Credit bonds,"" which have questions about their quality, are traded in dollar quotes, said one analyst. 
Moody's Investors Service rates the company's senior unsecured debt Baa1, but recently placed the debt on review for downgrade. Both Standard & Poor's Corp. and Fitch rate the debt triple-B-plus. 
But the company ""may be going into the double-B (non-investment grade) sector, "" said Harold Rivkin, principal of H. Rivkin & Co., a distressed debt brokerage firm, Princeton, N.J. 
""I am starting to get inquiry from investment grade holders about the market for Enron bonds,"" Rivkin said, noting that some high-grade portfolios can't have paper below investment-grade. 
Houston-based Enron, the nation's biggest energy trader, recently announced a large third-quarter loss and an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission into a partnership arrangement that involves the company's chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow. 
Enron has approached Citicorp (C) about obtaining a possible $750 million loan, according to a source close to the bank. But the source indicated Tuesday that nothing has proceeded past the preliminary inquiry. 
The company's stock, while once a favorite of the investment community, has taken a pounding. It traded early this year at more than $80 a share. Late Wednesday, it was at $15.70 a share. 
And, in a reflection of current investor sentiment, for the second time this week analyst Carol Coale of Prudential Securities downgraded the company to a sell recommendation from a hold. Her concern is ""not because of the things we know but because of the things that we potentially don't know.""

USA: Group to put corporate directors under microscope.
By Kevin Drawbaugh

10/24/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
WASHINGTON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Directors of corporations will be graded according to their performance by a service expected to be launched soon by business research group The Corporate Library, the group's cofounder said on Wednesday. 
In a move that could cause some sweaty palms in boardrooms across the country, long-time shareholder activist Nell Minow said directors will be awarded grades of A, B, C and lower, based on meeting attendance and other benchmarks.
""It's always been my dream to rate individual directors like bonds. Directors have not had the scrutiny they deserve,"" said Minow, who said the service will be called Board Analyst. 
Planned as an added feature on an existing Web site, thecorporatelibrary.com, Board Analyst is still in testing stages but is expected to launch next year, she said. 
Only directors of U.S. companies will initially be evaluated. Non-U.S. directors may be added later. 
Minow and partner Robert Monks have written several books on corporate governance and shareholder rights. They formerly managed the Washington-based shareholder activist Lens Fund, which they sold last year to British fund management group Hermes. 
Their latest venture may find a receptive audience on the institutional buy-side, said industry spokespersons. 
""There's been growing interest within our membership in board membership, in general, and individual directors, in particular. I definitely think there would be interest in more information on individual directors,"" said Ann Yerger, spokeswoman for the Council of Institutional Investors, which represents America's large pension funds. 
The corporate governance movement since its beginnings in the 1970s has focused on making directors more accountable and responsible. Many companies have responded by requiring more outside directors and more meaningful stock ownership among directors. But examples of lax board oversight still abound. 
One example would be Enron Corp. , whose stock has plunged in recent days since the company said the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating transactions involving certain outside partnerships and the company's chief financial officer, Minow said. 
""Where was the Enron board in all of this?"" she asked. ""Boards and outside consultants are supposed to vet ideas for partnerships like these. That apparently didn't happen here."" 
Taking the corporate governance argument a step further, Minow argued that effective board membership is more than a theoretical question. It should be an issue for investors to evaluate when they consider buying stock in a company. 
""This isn't just a corporate governance thing. This is part of investment analysis,"" she said. 
Institutional investors routinely examine corporate management when analyzing stocks. Whether they will begin to examine directors, as well, remained an open question. 
""Nell and Bob Monks have been shareholder activists for a long time and have moved corporate governance in a positive direction,"" said Peter Gleason, vice president of research and development at the National Association of Corporate Directors, which represents more than 3,000 corporate directors. 
Surveys by the association recently showed that corporate directors rank self-evaluation high on their list of concerns. ""More and more directors are saying this is something we should be doing,"" Gleason said.

Lynn,

Thanks for the additional input from the Gas Logistics experts.  I think you are correct that a long term solution will require acceptance of procedural changes by Oneok.  I think the Richfield storage idea should be looked at.  To my knowledge, there isn't any storage activity at this field but maybe there could be.  

In the mean time, I am going to propose that we put an OBA in place for the new customer I am trying to satisfy right now.  The OBA can be revoked on 48 hours notice if we can come up with a better idea.  I have strung this guy along as long as I can.  I will let everyone know when we pick this issue up again.

				Penny

Subject:	NNG - South End Small customer deliveries


	Penny and Michelle, I met with Larry Berger, Terry Kowalke and Raetta Zadow this morning
	to review yesterday's meeting on the concerns for DDVC's at ""small customer delivery points""
	on the southend of NNG's system. Through our discussions, here are a few ideas including some
	of yesterday's discussion.  These ideas may be somewhat out of the norm, but we thought we
	would at least  throw them on the table.

	1.  If Oneok cannot supply these deliveries, then Oneok should agree with us to lift the requirement
	     that the supply has to be upstream of the delivery in the Bushton Universe.  It can still be
	     required in the ""Bushton Universe"", just not as restrictive as it is today.

	2.  If Oneok cannot supply these deliveries, then Oneok should allow us to do storage true ups
	     at 8:00 a.m. at the end of the gas day to eliminate DDVC.

	3.  If these deliveries are on Firm contracts, can we sell them SMS to cover these small volumes
	     even though they are in the field area?

	4.  Richfield Storage point - (I am not sure it is even active)  -  Could we get Oneok to agree to 
	     allow true ups if we are supplying the true up with gas coming from the Richfield storage point?
	     I am sure this alternative would need to include the storage group.

	We would be glad to participate in any future discussions.  Thanks. Lynn

Beginning  10/1/2001, TMS stopped excluding city gates locations from the allocation, thereby they would be subject to allocation, where they were not before,  this was requested by John Buchanan.  Unfortunately or fortunately, NNG customers do not nominate a large portion of their gas to theses city gate locations, rather they nominate to the zone locations, so there is a 99.9% probability, that these city gates would never have to be allocated any way.  

Currently in TMS we exclude the zone nomination locations (OPS type) from the allocation process.  Therefore my question is, since we wanted to include the city gates in the allocation process do we also want to include the zone delivery locations in the allocation process?  Bewlow is a list of OPS type points.

Hasan,

We have been asked to retrieve some information to assist us in our decision making regarding a tariff filing on TW. We would like to see the Final Operational Capacity vs. Final Scheduled volume by day from Oct. 2000 to Oct. 2001. for these groups.

I/B Link   Group      28
San Jaun Group     26
West of Thoreau    24

We also need to know when these groups were allocated during this same time frame by day. We would like to have all this information by next Wednesday, November 7th if possible. If not, please let me know as soon as possible. The information only needs to be sent to me to reconfigure. Thank you.

Lynn, 
Here's the recipe that I was telling you about.  It's delicious! 

Vincent Price's Bread Pudding 
Ever since the late actor, Vincent Price, shared his recipe for bread pudding with chef Bob Blakesly of Rancho Bernardo Inn in San Diego, Price's pudding has been on top of the dessert list.

? cup raisins
? cup brown sugar, packed
8 slices white bread
3 eggs, beaten
4 cups milk
1 ? teaspoons vanilla

To:		Gas Control
From: 		Shelley Corman
Subject: 	Fire Drills and Emergency Response

Periodically we review our procedures during fire drills in the building. Historically, I understand that the Gas Controllers on duty have not moved to the stairwells during a drill. We need to change that practice. We are required by the Fire Marshall to have everyone move to the stairwells during future fire drills. The short time normally required to be away from the console until the all-clear is sounded should not impact the integrity of the pipeline systems. 

We are also reviewing our short notice emergency response procedures. We have excellent procedures for events such as hurricanes, but we are preparing for events, such as a threat that would require everyone to leave the building immediately. Our interim offsite location in these situations is the Enron hanger at Intercontinental Airport. In the near future, we will be conducting a drill of these procedures, so don't be surprised if someone from our management team comes into Gas Control and asks you to proceed to the hanger on short notice. 

Thanks in advance for your co-operation, and thank you for the great job everyone is doing."

	Effective November 1, 2001, Northern implemented new posting procedures regarding capacity availability.  These procedures are attached.  Several changes have been implemented.  In summary, the following changes have been incorporated:

The Unsubscribed Capacity Report has been updated to reflect the gas day two (2) days in the future vs fourteen (14) days.
a ""new"" Short Term Sustainable Capacity (STSC) Report has been posted beginning on the November 1st gas day.  This report is displayed on Northern's website under the Informational Posting; Capacity; Unsubscribed Capacity  
a ""new"" rolling 30 day Unsubscribed Daily Capacity Report is posted each morning for day-to-day transactions.  Daily capacity can be posted by point or group but must be identified with an asterisk (*) on the STSC Report at least one business day before being posted on the Unsubscribed Daily Capacity Report.   

	Please take a moment to review these report on the website.  If I have left anyone off this distribution that may be affected or interested in the procedures, please forward on.  If you have any questions or concerns regarding these procedures please let me know.  Thanks MW

The revised invoices for Duke contracts 27291 and 27349 appear to be correct.  The attached schedule shows the estimated revenue impact and the actual revised billing for both contracts.  The invoices are going out today to the customer along with an explanation for the change.  I will strive to capture the alternate deliveries to California calculation each month and forward the data to Lorraine and Jan/Jeanette.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

I would like to add the following items to the agenda.  I believe that coming to a resolution on these issues will increase both the efficiency and effectiveness of the TW team.

	-Team members hours of coverage, and job responsibilities
	-Rotating team coverage responsibility in an emergency, and possible solutions to minimize unexpected coverage issues 	(weekdays, weekends, and late nights)

Thank You,
Christine

      With the customer service items put before us from Shelley and Lynn. It appears to me that now is a good time to review some items surrounding the team environment. This is a way for the TW team to show how or what we are doing to provide customer service. Thank You.
 

Agenda Items:

1.  Extended time away from desk (Lunches, Workouts, Meetings, etc.)
2.  Key information being passed along regarding your shippers or operators (Imbalances, OBA's, PG&E re-alignment, etc.)
3.  Best way to keep all team members informed of special deals (E-mail, Voice mail, Common folder, etc.)
4.  Best way to pass all information from days to nights and nights to day.
5.  Adequate coverage when away from desk (Share the work load, Don't make the same people stay behind, Mix it up)
6.  Keep all Team Advisors informed. (John Buchanan, Terry Kowalke, Darrell Schoolcraft, and Gary Spraggins)      
7.  Key to the above 6 items (Open line of communication)

Earlier this year I requested that the Enron litigation unit file suit against Oasis Dairy for collection of unpaid transport bills on TW.  The suit was filed in the fifth judicial district court in Chaves County, NM.  

On October 1, 2001, TW was granted summary judgement in the case by the court in the amount of $29,250.56 inclusive of back interest and attorney fees.  This amount will continue to accrue interest at 8.75% per annum until paid by Oasis.  

If you would like a copy of the judgement, please let me know.

I wanted to make sure everyone was aware of the changes that we have had so far to the available short-term sustainable/daily capacity approvals/postings.  The attached file shows the points that have been approved as potential points for short term sustainable and/or daily capacity.  We currently have 20,000 MMBtu/day posted as available short term sustainable capacity for the month of November for Ventura and Demarc as receipts.  We also have 3,600 MMBtu/day posted as available short term sustainable capacity for the month of November for East leg deliveries.  Daily we may/may not have available 5,000 East Leg delivery capacity and 20,000 Carlton delivery capacity.

Several of the points that have been approved for sale of short term capacity if it becomes available currently show no available firm capacity for the rest of November.  These points include:  TBPL/Beatrice, Pony Express, and Mullinville as receipts and Keystone as a delivery.  If gas control and planning determine we can support additional receipts/deliveries at these points, the available capacity postings could change.

If you have questions or would like to know where the postings are located on our website, let me know.  Also, please forward this on to other members of your team that I haven't included above.  Thanks.

As a clarification, the daily capacity which may be available at Carlton will only be a consideration on non Carlton resolution days rather than non-SOL days.  The attached file shows this.

Hey Steve,
Kim and I have been looking at your spreadsheet.  I am attaching our
spreadsheet so you can see how we came up with our numbers.  It looks like
there is a pricing problem on your spreadsheet.  You have a price for
1/18/00 and there isn't pricing for that day.  The Jan00L tab in our
spreadsheet calculates the current invoice.  The Jan00S tab calculates what
we should have paid, inclusive of PPAs.  Kim tells me that our worksheets
are per the contract.  If you have questions, please email me or give me a
call.  Hopefully we can get this worked out as soon as possible.
Thanks!

Mike,

I spoke with Steve Sweeney at Cogentrix today regarding this spreadsheet, and he would like to see our data for every day from June 1, 2001 through September 30, 2001 as you calculated for the few random days throughout the summer.  The spreadsheet seems to indicate that we did not allocate Cogentrix on some of the days in question.  This information is contrary to the information Steve provided and must be explored further. 

Steve is getting impatient with this process.  He would like to see this come to a resolution as soon as possible.  I said that I understand his concern and we will do our best to resolve this in a timely matter.  

Kent, once Mike finishes the spreadsheet, I recommend that we meet and discuss our offer to Cogentrix.

Subject:	Galena/Belleville Firm Volume Split

I have attached a Excel file that includes the Galena/Belleville firm contract volume split out and their respective per cents.  The first page of the sheet has the summary of the data and Galena/Belleville split out, with the second and third sheets indicating the firm contracted volumes in the two groups for the 2001 heating season.

Madison Gas, in their firm contract 21340, does have the ability to deliver to both Madison (POI 53782 - 47,830 MMBTUD) and ANR/NNG Janesville (POI 180 - 46,469 MMBTUD), however, the total at the two points should not exceed 47,830 MMBTUD.  Contractually this creates a ""double dip"" in the CAS groupings that we ""adjust"" out of the system.  

The total firm behind Galena is 348,719 MMBTUD and Belleville 258,666 MMBTUD, including the one Daily firm contract for November.  Without the daily firm contract the firm volume is 340,119 MMBTUD for Galena and 250,066 MMBTUD for Belleville.  Please note that with the CAS groupings any firm volumes in the Belleville group are also included in the Galena group.  The Wisconsin Gas contracts are split between the two groups with Galena at 50,490 MMBTUD and Belleville at 25,2444 MMBTUD.  If in the nomination process you include all the Wisconsin Gas Zone nomination in the Belleview group, rather than split the volumes between Galena and Belleville, the  total Belleville nominations could be as high as 275,310 MMBTUD.  Other shippers that have firm volumes split in the two groups include Madison, WEPCO, WP&L and WPS Energy.  The per cent spilt by shipper is indicated in red on the first page of the attached Excel file.

Call if you have any questions.

	I guess the question is - have we ever actually reviewed when we call on the SBA volumes and what the system conditions have been during those periods.  We want to verify that we are not allocating a point when we have SBA gas flowing.  Theatrically, we argue that we would not call on SBAs if the gas was not needed to meet system requirements.  We' want to verify that the theory and the actual match up.  I hope this makes sense.  Thanks MW

Yes, you are correct. The changes in the business requirements for the scheduling priority of SBA contracts will not impact NNG's primary firm shippers. What do you need to verify and support this fact?

Mike/Steve - we have verified all of the volume information and our numbers are correct.  Their numbers do not include prior period adjustments in the correct production month and our PVR volumes are correct and agree with the worksheets that they sent us even though they didn't use the correct volumes for the PVR on their worksheets.  We still cannot figure out how they got to the amounts that they invoiced us.  Please let me know if we are going to go back to those months that we underbilled them so that NNG can recoup that money.  If you have any questions, let me know.

Thanks,

Dana,

Let me know if this is closer to what you want. 
There are three tabs in the report.
	 1) Summary by Customer
	 2) Summary by Amounts
	 3) Detail by Customer

The data is exported from SAP into an Excel spreadsheet. It takes 20 minutes to run the SAP report, export to Excel and format the Excel spreadsheet. A Business Objects report is refreshed (takes about a minute) to pick up the most current data from the Excel spreadsheet. 

The reports can be accessed directly from Business Objects if you prefer. I sent you the Business Objects report also.

	I have reviewed to orders issued by FERC.  They state ""Pipelines acquiring upstream capacity without prior Commission approval will be ""at-risk"" for the cost of that capacity"".  This means that Northern will need to track both the costs and revenues associated with offsystem transactions.  We believe that in tracking the revenues we can track by contract.  

	Therefore, I believe in the meeting that if we needed to track these transactions Sue's group would maintain a manual spreadsheet for all off-system transactions.

	We also said Dan Fancler would need to review and determine how we would track the revenues thru the accounting side.  

	I believe we have provided the answers we committed to in the meeting yesterday for today.  I plan to meet with Lynn B. tomorrow to discuss nominations, contract approval processes and other stuff.....  I'll let you know where we are as things develop.  thanks MW

Subject:	Transok Offsystem Fuel Accounting Procedure

Based on our meeting 10/9/2001, I would like to propose the following accounting procedures for expensing in-kind fuel.

Case A:  In October 500,000 dts moves offsystem with only 486,000 dts expected to be returned to NNG in January.

NNG moves 500,000 dts from physical inventory to Offsystem inventory. No accounting entry made to the G/L.

Gas Accounting would reduce Offsystem inventory 14,000 dts to reflect in-kind fuel reduction in the same month the next NNG gas purchase transaction occurs (FIFO inventory method).  Reducing the Offsystem storage will cause UAF to increase, however purchasing gas for Operational Storage and not recording it to Operational Storage will offset the UAF increase.  If the next gas purchase transaction occurs in December at $3.00 then we would reduce Offsystem Storage Inventory by 14,000 dts in December production.  December UAF would not be affected.

Recorded in December:
Debit 858 3rd Party Transport exp		14,000 * $3.00 = $42,000
	Credit A/P							($42,000)

Procedural Note:  All Third Party Offsystem storage statements must be forwarded to Gas Accounting (Dan Fancler) in order to reconcile the Physical to the Books.  Reconciling items such as in-kind fuel reductions will be reported to Storage Marketing noting that purchases for in-kind fuel replacements are needed.

If NNG purchases 100,000 dt for Operational Storage in December, then 14,000 dts would be carved out as in-kind fuel replacement and recorded to 858 (3rd party transport), the remaining 86,000 dts would be recorded as Operational Storage purchase and encroachment.  We may wish for the vender to issue two invoices.


Case B	 In October 500,000 dts moves offsystem, NNG purchases the in-kind replacement on Transok's system and 500,000  dts is expected to be returned to NNG in January.

NNG moves 500,000 dts from physical inventory to Offsystem inventory. No accounting entry made to the G/L.
NNG does not reduce the offsystem physical inventory.

Recorded in month of purchase on Transok's system:
Debit 858 3rd Party Transport exp		14,000 * $3.00 = $42,000
	Credit A/P							($42,000)

In both cases all transactions are recorded outside of operational storage, but gives Marketing some flexibility on when the in-kind replacement takes place but still follows a logical methodology (FIFO replacement).

Brad,

This is what I would like to convey to the users at this time.  Also, let everyone know that I am available to attend their individual staff meetings.


The Business Objects IT staff is currently in the process of upgrading the hardware and software for Business Objects.  The hardware will provide better processing times and more stability.  The software upgrade will provide some bug fixes and enhancements.

As far as the effect to the users, the impact should be minimal.  

If the users accesses Business Objects through InfoSource.ETS.Enron.com, there will be no changes.
If the users accesses BO through ZABO, they will need the new version installed.  This will accomplished through a Corp script that will either push the new software onto the users PC or they will have to select a Start menu item.

The go live date is Dec 1.

Lori Saffer will be sending reminder e-mails as the deadline approaches.  

Thank you for all your help,
Lori Saffer

Gary and I discussed this today and he is going to have Frankie pull the charts and input the daily volumes in PGAS.  We will compare and see what the impact is to the DDVC penalties.  Any questions please give me a call.  j.  floyd

Gary,  I received a call on 11/13 from Bill Lindley (Clayton Energy) agent for City of Hartley, IA.  Bill was inquiring about the actual daily volume allocations at POI 60551, Meter Number 722015-01.  He incurred about $5,503.35 in DDVC penalties for the month of Oct.  2001 due to daily variances at the TBS.  Bill was asking if the actuals were estimated from the 17th - 31st.  In checking with Frankie the end of the month index readings were used to estimate the volume due to the chart being received after close.  

Bill (Clayton Energy) has requested that we pull the chart(s) and check the reading to verify that the penalties and the daily volume are correct for the month of Oct..  Bill has provided me with the daily readings from his check meter at this TBS to compare with.  This check will determine if the daily volumes need to be reallocated and a PPA generated.  

Give me a call if you have any questions.

Thank you for taking time to come to our Gas Logistics Staff meeting on Tuesday.  My apologies to those individuals that were inadvertently dropped from the email distribution.  I will schedule time to visit with anyone that missed the staff meeting.

I know that you are all still searching for answers to the Enron events of the last few weeks.   You asked lots of good questions at the meeting.  At the bottom of this email are responses to a few additional questions.  As I said at the meeting, while I am discouraged by recent events, I am really proud of ETS and of our Gas Logistics Team and I am looking forward to showing off our pipeline successes to the Dynegy management team in the future. 

With the Thanksgiving holiday just around the corner, I'd like to take the opportunity to wish you and your family a safe and happy holiday season.  I hope that you can spend time with your families and friends away from the demands of work.  I'd also like to put two dates on your calendar to celebrate work accomplishments with our team.

Team Celebration.  First, I hope you can attend a celebration on November 29 at the Doubletree honoring the Gas Logistics team and the new Contracts/Capacity Release team.  The celebration will include food, games and prizes.  Alma Carillo will be sending out all the details.  
Holiday Luncheon.  Second, get out your recipe books and start cooking, because it's also time for our Gas Logistics Holiday Banquet on December 11th in ECN42C2 from 11:30am - 1:30pm.  I'll provide the ham and turkey and team members can sign-up to bring a covered dish.  Ricki Winters will send around a sign-up sheet to make sure that we don't end up with 10 green bean casseroles. 

Follow-Up Q/A

Can Employees still order computers from the Click at Home program?
As of today, the Click at Home program has not been cancelled.  The web site is working and eligible employees are able to place orders.

Regarding loans from the Saving Plan, is there any requirement for accelerated loan payment if the value of the loan exceeds the current value of the savings plan account?
For active employees, loan payment amounts will not change during the term of the loan, even if the outstanding balance of the loan exceeds the value of the account.

Does the company have any position on employee participation in class action suits?  
No.  The decision whether to participate in a suit is a personal decision and is unrelated to an individual's employment.

The attached is a result of a phone call that I made to Rita to find out where we may have talked about daily measurement in the tariff just in case we need to explain this further to the Measurement Group.

Thanks,

Subject:	Daily Measurement


I looked at the tariff and talked to Mary Darveaux.  NNG must have true daily measured volumes, as opposed to a monthly measurement divided by days in the month, for several business reasons.

References to daily volumes and calculations are sprinkled throughout the tariff.
1.  For example, under the TF & TFX Rate Schedules, the tariff states that the MDQ (maximum daily quantity) is the firm service that NNG is obligated to provide on a daily basis.  We can't provide a daily service if we do not have daily measurements.
2.  Curtailment provisions in the tariff require DAILY measurement.
3.  DDVCs require accurate DAILY measurement.  DDVCs are a part of NNG's revenue.  Even if NNG were to bill on scheduled volumes at the beginning of the month, true-up to actuals would be required.  DDVCs would not disappear, they would simply move from the commodity billing to imbalance billing after measurement close.  Order 637 may change some aspects of DDVCs but it will not eliminate them or change the daily nature of the abuses DDVCs are designed to discourage.

Furthermore - 
1.  That's the way the gas transportation industry operates.  It may not be a GISB standard, but it is a fact of life.  
2.  Most contracts executed through EOL are for 1-2 days of service at a time.  Gas flowing at a point could vary significantly during the month and a point may be used by different parties at different times.  We can't just assume that the same amount flowed every day for everyone.
3.  Overrun charges are based on gas flows above the contract MDQ (Maximum DAILY Quantity) each day of the month.  Using an artificial, average daily measurement would mask overrun volumes (and reduce NNG revenue, since Overrun pays a higher rate than firm commodity).  A shipper could avoid paying overrun if it flowed below MDQ on some days and above on others.
4.  We have several contracts with volumetric provisions which cannot be accurately billed without DAILY measurements.  An example would be Utilicorp and all of its Taconite contracts.
5.  NNG is looking at moving to daily dollar-valued OBAs.  If NNG can't tell what is flowing on a daily basis, customers can game the system by pushing extra gas into the pipe on days when the price is lower and withdrawing it on other days when the price is slightly higher.  Gas prices can fluctuate considerably during the month.  Multiplied times a bcf of gas, even a fraction of a cent change adds up to real money.  "

Shelley & Lynn,   Fran has advised me there are no legal problems with schedulers working a weekend shift from 7 am to 10 pm for one weekend day, the other scheduler will take the other day.  Each will be given a two days of comp time as they are today for their two 8 hour shifts. Fran does have a concern of fatigue in the later hours, just a we do.  There are only two team members that are interested in this schedule, so we'll give it a try and let you know how it goes.  Sheila"

Reyna and Michele,

What do you think of the idea that We place the NNG and Procedures for Offsystem Transactions in a header to the document with Michele's as Part A - Initiation & Regulatory; Reyna's Part B - Deal making and Mine Part C Nominations & Scheduling. From that the procedures could be subdivide for 3rd Party storage or transportation.

Reyna... also in your Part B & C Specific Deal & Fuel....It is Gas Logistics' recommendation that Marketing e-mail the Deal/Purchase sheet to Chris and Debbie with copies going to Lynn and Myself. That way in Chris' absence, someone can follow up on the nom/scheduling.

Gary could you provide me with a list of the 7, 16, and 31 day NNG charts for the month of Oct. that were received late for measurement close.  Gas Logistics, Marketing and Operations is trying to get a feel for the number(s) of late charts that GMS is receiving.  If you have any question please give me a call.

In our effort to decide if we need to re-negotiate contract 101021 and 101073 with Duke to possibly eliminate the BTU Daily Gas Wire numbers and instead use the Gas Daily numbers, I have attached a spreadsheet that gives the Gas Daily and BTU Daily Gas Wire numbers for Mid 13 and Demarc.  Randy, could you please run the Gas Daily numbers in your calculation for the last 13 months?  We would like to see the bottom line impact between using the BTU Daily Gas Wire publication vs. the Gas Daily publication.  We are hoping this will give some insight on whether it would be beneficial to us to re-negotiate the 2 contracts. 
Thanks,
Courtney Barker

Bob, Jean, Scott, and I drafted this up. They are intended to be the front and back for 3 laminated cards. They provide
the plan for responding to a very short notice or no notice evacuation of the Enron Building. The first card is for what 
I have called (we can rename the group) the BCP 1st Responders. This would include the BCP Directors and Coordinators, 
ETS Business and IT Team Leads, Mgrs, Dirs, VPs, and key staff, and ENW Contacts. The second card is for the OCC. 
The third card is for the remainder of the ETS BCP Team members, both Business and IT staff. 

Jean is touching up the OCC ETS BCP defined call burst groups and messages to match this process. Bob and I will
be completing the Hangar Offsite layout, setup process, teams, and other documentation on Monday. We will get the
documentation mounted and stored at the Hangar for use during an activation. We will also get the equipment stored 
at the Hangar. 

There is a meeting planned for Tuesday, at which we should be able to finalize the initial process, and schedule the
first test. 

Get us your comments on the attachments. We tried to keep it short and simple, but with enough detail to avoid 
confusion during such an event. 

Thanks, Gary

	FYI.  Wanted to pass on this information.  After working with Minnegasco to help them
	use Park and Ride as much as possible (considering we were allocating storage), the
	Minnegasco scheduler went into the system for Friday's gas day and changed their business
	between Intraday 1 and Intraday 2.  This caused cuts through Demarc and Mid 17.  We 
	tried to help as much as possible and keep the same rules we have with all other shippers.
	If you have any questions, please let me know.   Thanks. Lynn

Lynn, the training went well.  We covered the following topics:

	- 8 a.m. true up process and how to avoid mistakes or invalid codes
	- Winter Power Pak agreement and true up process
	- Information about realigning their Demarc and Beatrice volumes
	- Differences between Demarc and Mid 17 Pool
	- Addressed EDI issues (will discuss with Mary Draemer to resolve)
	- Identifying cuts and utilizing the ""Detect"" tool in TMS
	- Also discussed Powertex and Pinnacle power plants since Xcel operates SPS
	- Discussed how and when path rankings come into play and how to avoid 
	  cutting their long term deals versus their daily gas

These were just a few of the topics I can think of off the top of my head, but overall I think the meeting was a success from an NNG and Xcel standpoint.  Let me know if you need anymore information.  Thanks.

Randy

Hello,

Xcel has requested that we provide an afternoon of training at their offices in Denver (similar to last year).  The training would go from 12:00 PM - 4:30 PM on 11/15/01 and would cover any nomination/scheduling questions they have.  Xcel has also asked to have someone there to specifically address capacity release and the final AM true-up process.

Please let me know who you would recommend as representatives from NNG.  I would like to get back to Xcel by this Thursday regarding our attendees.

Lynn:  Please verify that if Koch realigns their 35,000/d contract (K# 20510)such that their MDQ at Carlton matches their Carlton flow obligation of 2,828 and has the rest of their 32,172/d at Marshall (They would need to realign 30 mcf from Carlton to Marshall to effectuate the above, and I've checked with Doug Aschwege to make sure he would approve it.) that Steve's and my interpretation as described below is correct.  Basically the question is whether the Carlton flow obligation is only the Tariff stated volume (ie., no fuel imputed) and that the remainder of the MDQ plus fuel on the whole 35,000/d will flow as primary firm receipts at Marshall.  Thanks for your help!

Bob, 

Per our conversations earlier this month,  My contract 20510 needs to have
only 2828 mmbtu at Carlton and 32172 at Marshall.  All of the fuel for the
transport needs to be taken from Marshall.  Currently, this contract has
2858 at Carlton.  This is 30 above my obligation.  After this change is
made, it is my expectation that under no circumstances will my volume at
Carlton be curtailed below a receipt volume of 32568 at Marshall.   A
combination of 2828 plus 32568 gives me a delivered volume of 35000.  That
is my firm entitlement and curtailments below that are unacceptable as long
as my nominations are primary FT.

Please contact me at 713-544-4017 if more clarification is needed.

Thank you.  

Steve Phillips"

In my mind he is a definite keeper - one that Marketing will probably be trying to get there hands on in the future if you don't watch out!  Thank you for having him participate with us.  Bob

Hello,

Xcel has requested that we provide an afternoon of training at their offices in Denver (similar to last year).  The training would go from 12:00 PM - 4:30 PM on 11/15/01 and would cover any nomination/scheduling questions they have.  Xcel has also asked to have someone there to specifically address capacity release and the final AM true-up process.

Please let me know who you would recommend as representatives from NNG.  I would like to get back to Xcel by this Thursday regarding our attendees.

Just wanted to let everyone know about this change in the Carlton commodity surcharge - this will be effective 11/01/2001 and will take the place of the old $.04 charge that we used to see on deliveries to Mid 17 for the winter months.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thanks,

Raetta

In case you haven't heard, last week we received FERC approval to change the Carlton commodity surcharge from $.0062 to .0175.
I have sent the updates to IT to load into TRS for this winter and for the next 3 years (through 3/2005).  The surcharge may change before 2005, but I thought it would be better to have our most recent approved rate than to leave it at either zero or $.04.

Please pass this information along to anyone in your area that needs to know.

Thanks."

The Christmas Cards are in and I have gone ahead and merged them into labels for the envelopes for TW, NNG (North & South) Teams.  There are many wholes on the NNG labels and you may want to visit with the teams before printing.

I should have the labels here tomorrow, we have plenty of time.

Thank you, Ricki

If they were to schedule their gas directly to Golden Spread POI- 71395, operations could put them on the suction side of Plains turbine if we got full. Also Golden Spread would have to agree to flow the gas on a 24 hour basis and not 16 hour day.

Joe was visiting with Crystal Hand and Sam Rhodes, Oxy Permian, the operator for Altura Gaines (POI #78023), this morning.  

They again expressed interest in increasing their capability to flow more volume at the above by increasing the orifice plate at the meter station.  They also have included estimated costs in their upcoming budget to increase the capacity at the processing plant to accommodate increased production anticipated in the first to second quarter of 2002.  If this plate change occurred, Altura could theoretically flow up to 30,000 dths/d into NNG.  They are projecting 40,000 dths/d.  

They are also talking with Mustang at the 26""Plains i/c since they could deliver volume back to Mustang which could then flow to NNG or EPNG -- this might relieve the volume in the Hobbs System where other producers could increase their volumes.  However, Mustang doesn't want to pay the transport.  We understand Aquila owns Mustang.

Sherry has visited with Matt Chance, Dynegy, along with Debra Tower, scheduler who monitors the volumes at Warren Eunice (POI #6751).  Matt has expressed concern regarding the frequent allocation of the Hobbs System -- severely affects Dynegy's equity volumes.

Joe and I are passing along this information for your consideration in addition to the GPM Linam Ranch point.

I like Terry's suggestion.  In fact, in the preceding paragraph and the following paragraph where we refer to ""shippers"", we could refer to ""customers"" instead.

Subject:	RE: SoCal Gas CPUC Proceeding 

I agree with Lindy, I don't believe we want to mention anything about ""Shipper Imbalances"" my suggestion is to restate this paragraph like this:

In instances where SoCalGas happens to issue an Operational Flow Order (""OFO"") during the Intraday 2 cycle, it can create imbalances with Transwesterns Customers. Because it does not afford Transwestern an opportunity to pass along these reductions to our upstream parties. When an OFO is issued in the Intraday 2 Cycle, an allocation is passed on to Transwestern through the confirmation process with SoCalGas.  Due to the timing of these OFO's, Transwestern is not afforded an opportunity to confirm such reductions with Transwestern's upstream parties.

If you have further questions, please give me a call. Thank you.

We are still getting some info together for Chris, but thought that you might find Jeff's memo to Chris interesting since it has to do with DDVC's and estimated volume data from Measurement.

Thanks,

Raetta

Raetta - Can you obtain access to the October data that Alliant is referring to?
Jodie - Were there any measurement problems at the gates Alliant referenced?
Jean/Raetta - Can we produce a monthly statement of all estimated data (see Jeff's request at bottom of email)?

I would like to respond to Jeff today.  Please email or call me.  Thanks!

  We need to address this email asap

Chris,

I just got done reviewing some of the data in the October SMS invoice for IES and I can see some major problems.  It looks to me like about 1/2 of the gates have daily estimated usage during the last half of the month which caused us to incur numerous DDVC penalties which I don't believe are correct in both Zone BC and Zone D.

It was obvious that the data was estimated because the flow is almost exactly the same every day for the last two weeks of the month (I suspect it only varies a little due to the BTU factor).  We were getting penalties on the warm days in the second half of the month because you are overestimating the load on those days.  Some of the larger gates to look at include Cherokee(2870), Jefferson(2873), Iowa Falls(2876), Britt(2877) Eldora(2878), Mt Vernon(2880), Vinton(2881) & Alto (3574), but there are many others.

I need to look at this more a lot more, including other months, but before I waste more of my time, I'd like to know how and why these were estimated and if you are already working on a correction.  This is the kind of thing that makes in very difficult for us because we have to rely on your billing data which only is available two weeks after a month ends and that isn't even very good.  The way you are doing it, I don't even understand how you can bill us for DDVC's.  

From now on, I think I'd like to get a statement each month of all the estimated data when we get the bill, so we know what to look for. 

Thanks,
Jeff

In a second conference call with Alliant, they requested Northern provide them with the storage injection allocations (on Intraday 2) that occurred from November, 1998 through April, 2001 (heating seasons only).

I told them this info must be retrieved from archives.  Let me know how long you think it will take to get this information.

Thanks!

	Unfortunately I will be on vacation on November 26th.  However, Gary will be attending and is well versed and postured to speak to 16 and 31 day charted PD measurement.  Gary has been working behind the scenes with your group, the field, marketing and technology to resolve the problems associated with equipment not suited for providing adequate daily information.  At the same time he has been working on gaining assistance in getting 16 day measurement data into the office on time for processing and review prior to month's end close.   Just as a side note, I understand now that Charlie Thompson of the Measurement Technology Group and Tech Ops has been given the charge to come up with a five year plan for installing automated and adequate equipment accross the board for these situations.

I hope that you can both make it to the meeting on Monday to discuss the issue of daily NNG measurement readings.  A number of our NNG customers are protesting DDVC invoices based on our inability to provide daily measurement information.   Alliant is just the latest in the string of customers.   The NNG marketing group is very frustrated on this issue.  

We need to put all our collective talents together.  This issue needs the highest levels of attention possible from measurement.

Frank, 

Accounting has indicated our October invoice has some DDVC and IT overrun charges that our metering does not show.  Before we can pay these, we would need you to verify the measurement of all of our stations.  Bill and his SCADA folks believe the untelemetered allocations are inaccurate, and likely causing the DDVC and overrun.  

I have asked our Accounting group to short pay the October DDVC's of $26,374; and to also short pay the associated transport invoice for the IT overrun of $29,704.52; a total disputed cost of $56.078.52.  

Let me know if you need any additional information, a brief recap of the disputed charges are shown below, 

Thanks, 

Tom

Lynn, we had a conference call with Kelly and Jeff yesterday. Chris was on the call also. We got nowhere, so then Kent and Steve Kirk called them later and explained how the process works and that we can't ""reserve"" capacity for them. They hung up on Steve and Kent. Shelley has been brought up to speed. thanks. sj

** High Priority **

Per discussion with Chris Sebesta, Alliant Energy has been informed of impending storage allocations for the upcoming holiday weekend.

For the weekend, we want to schedule maximum storage withdrawals (to protect against zone allocations) and we want to ""schedule"" the firm right to reduce our withdrawal to zero in the final nomination cycle.   We expect NNG to honor our FIRM MAX RATE storage contract rights before they schedule a single dth of interruptible storage.

Please confirm our firm rights for all 3 of our Alliant Energy Utilities.  We would like this confirmation by 3:00pm this afternoon in order to properly notify our customers of any necessary constraints.

Per my conversation with Chris this morning, she wanted me to pass this information on regarding some of the things that we have found that have to do with our TBS/End User problem.  We have some end user daily volumes that are more than the physical daily volume at their related TBS (which also may have to do with the problem that we have with 16 and 31 day charts not being read) - when that happens we end up overbilling the LDC.  The ones that we are having a problem with are Wisconsin Power and Light and Wisconsin Gas.  If you need any other details on this, please let me know or you can bring them up at our meeting on Monday.

Thanks,

I would recommend that we just have them nominate it out when it is convenient for TW and not charge them any additional fees.  Is there a procedure in place that will prevent us from missing a balance like this again?

In analyzing shipper imbalance statements, Laura Giambrone discovered a PNR balance of 10,000 Dth on the above noted contract. The balance was parked on TW on April 26, 2000 and PNM paid a $0.03 per Dth/d fee in that month . TW has not billed PNR fees on the balance since May 1, 2000. PNM has not inquired about nor nominated the redelivery of the quantities held by TW.
How should this matter be handled?

2. Is Plainview in the middle of the Permian Area?
3. If Plainview is the beginning or end of the Permian Area, which way is the gas flowing, North or South?
4. We have a flow capacity of 500,000 going north and south.
5. Location of any Deferred Delivery Point and Physical Receipt Point needs to be considered whether to be allocated or not depending on the way the gas is flowing.
6. The requirements need to consider all receipts and delivery locations whether upstream or downstream of Plainview and the flow of gas.

During a Plainview allocations, the following rules should apply. 

Exclude:
Transportation when receipt is in the Permian Area and the delivery is in the Permian Area (at a point other than DDP) [Medeles, Gerry]   No. 
Transportation when receipt is sourced from Permian Area Storage point and re-delivery is North of Plainview [Medeles, Gerry]   No. 

Include:
Transportation when receipt is in Permian Area and the delivery is a point North of Plainview [Medeles, Gerry]   No. 
Transportation when receipt in Permian Area and the delivery is to Permian Area DDP [Medeles, Gerry]   No. 

								(*DDP = Deferred Delivery Point)

Gerry and/or Joe.
I believe these rules are already part of the Plainview allocation. Can you verify that for me?
[Medeles, Gerry]  The only line items/nominations that are excluded from a group allocation, is gas that is received and delivered within the group. "

Subject:	RE: SBA Contracts

In a discussion with Steve Kirk, prior to changing the priorities, it was agreed that SBA shippers should have priority over Interruptible and Alternate shippers only.  Firm shippers would continue to have priority over SBA shippers.  Since Gerry's group implemented the changes, we have not been in a situation where a SBA was called to come in (or go out) at an allocated point.  Gerry's system requirements as to how the system would operate under these conditions would be the support you need to verify that Firm shippers have priority over SBAs.   

Gerry, would you forward Michelle a copy of the System Requirement?   Thanks.

Michele,
I'm not sure the information is readily available, if available at all. TMS data is only maintained, without extraordinary measures, for 6 months. It is my recollection that there may have been an allocation at a point where SBA gas was scheduled and when that occurred the standard allocation procedures were enforced. I think once we asked the shipper  to move the SBA activity to another point, but that was pre GISB. Unfortunately, because of the how the SBA's work, the pack, draft and peak points are negotiated in advance which limits the points to use. Also, the 28-30 hr lead time required for notification means that we have to anticipate what system conditions will become and therein use SBAs to improve system conditions. Sometimes we miss the mark, either cold weather does not materialize or moves in late or shipper activity increases and in hindsight, an SBA was not necessary.  

Reyna may have some additional insight in more recent SBA activities.

I am not sure I understand the question.  Do you mean at anytime we call on SBA volumes, we never/should not allocate the location?

	I guess the question is - have we ever actually reviewed when we call on the SBA volumes and what the system conditions have been during those periods.  We want to verify that we are not allocating a point when we have SBA gas flowing.  Theatrically, we argue that we would not call on SBAs if the gas was not needed to meet system requirements.  We' want to verify that the theory and the actual match up.  I hope this makes sense.  Thanks MW

Yes, you are correct. The changes in the business requirements for the scheduling priority of SBA contracts will not impact NNG's primary firm shippers. What do you need to verify and support this fact?

The following summarizes the results of our meeting......If you want to discuss further, please call me.

Break Field Area in 3 Regions / Allocate by point
The decision was made to sub-divide the Field Area storage group into two regions; South of Plainview and North of Plainview, rather than 3 regions or allocating by point. If it is determined that additional divisions are necessary in the future, such changes can be made at that time. Changes  to CAS are required. I have discussed the changes with Bob Johnson and Doug Aschwege and have learned that the changes are not difficult to make and could be made in a couple days. 
Gary Spraggins and I will determine which deferred delivery points are in these new field regions and then provide the information to Bob and Doug. 
 
Question:  Should this change be implemented immediately or should it wait until the beginning of the withdrawal season?
 
Change from 'net zero' approach / Provide minimum level of activity
The decision was made to table this concern for now. The scheduled activity that drives the allocation process does not guarantee physical pipeline operations. In most cases, the flexibility provided by the Cunningham Field allows Gas Control to adjust operations to maintain the required minimum level of injections/withdrawals into Redfield and Lyons. Further analysis is required. Steve Thomas, Larry Swett and I will continue to monitor the system conditions/operations that effect physical storage to determine if and what additional changes maybe warranted. 

Send ""Notice"" when final scheduled number exceeds operational capacity
The IT group will modify the scheduling cycle to add a procedure where the final net scheduled storage quantity is compared to the operational capacity set for storage. If the final scheduled quantity exceeds operational capacity, I will receive a notification via e-mail. The purpose here is to monitor occurrences to determine the magnitude of the problem. I will get with Gerry Medeles to finalize the matter.

Lynn, I have no problem with Shirley, however, since she has began working from home, I have had limited interaction with her due to our work schedules.  She mostly works with the late person (Jean) and the early person (Jerry).  Therefore, if it is at all possible to choose someone else from the team that I work with more closely, I would appreciate it.  Thanks.
 
Randy

In our effort to decide if we need to re-negotiate contract 101021 and 101073 with Duke to possibly eliminate the BTU Daily Gas Wire numbers and instead use the Gas Daily numbers, I have attached a spreadsheet that gives the Gas Daily and BTU Daily Gas Wire numbers for Mid 13 and Demarc.  Randy, could you please run the Gas Daily numbers in your calculation for the last 13 months?  We would like to see the bottom line impact between using the BTU Daily Gas Wire publication vs. the Gas Daily publication.  We are hoping this will give some insight on whether it would be beneficial to us to re-negotiate the 2 contracts. 
Thanks,
Courtney Barker

Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.
Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.
To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.
IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.
We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.
Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

Tim,

In the attached file I have calculated the following charges that I have
incurred because of NNG incorrectly listing my project storage injection
rates in your allocation system. By far the biggest cost to me is the way we
have changed or nominations of natural gas from are suppliers as the
spreadsheet will show. We made this change in the nomination for July,
August & September. In calculating our nomination we look at what we could
put firm into storage, plant usage on none run days and SMS if available. If
this was fixed back in June when we asked what was going on with storage and
over runs into storage. I would have order large volumes of the Tier I
instead of purchasing the more costly Tier II. If we nominated the higher
Tier I volumes we expected to see DDVC charge of $.40 on all days trying to
over run into storage. That would have been the case the way your system was
set up. Instead I have these higher cost to my suppliers.

Please call me with any question on the spreadsheet. You can verify
Whitewater DDVC & SMS for September. I believe it was around the 18 or 19
when the problem was fixed.

I have checked on the status of the 's after the move and they play a critical role in our communication plan if the Lucent phones are down.  (Big backhoes can dig ditches and accidentally cut cables as we have seen in the past.)  The 's  are outside of our current Lucent phone switch and give us
the ability to make outside calls.  

Currently 's  are located and connected correctly at the following locations:
	John Buchanan  EBN4270
	Pat Barry  EBN4279
	Tracy Minter EBN3979  

But, we need additional 's  installed at the following locations:
	Terry Kowalke  EBN3972
	Jack Howard EBN3910E
	Sherry Forbish EBN4275A

This will accommodate Gas Logistics interim phone coverage plan between moves.  Please check to determine if the cost of these additional installations were included in the regular move schedule.  If you have any questions, please advise.  We will place a ' at the reconnection site.  
Thanks for you assistance.

Rick, 

The South team would like to nominate several people in ETS for the Check it out Awards. 

We have three questions: 

        1. What is the procedure for completing an award 
        2.  Is their an amount limit per team? 
        3.  Is their an amount limit per individual?

I just ran several Shipper Scheduled Quanties reports and discovered the fomat had changed.  

I monitor several contracts for forecasting purposes and also provide Market Services invoicing 
information for revenues for negotiated rates and sharing revenues for volumes flowing West for USGT. 
I rely upon the Shipper Scheduled Quantities report to get the information I need.  Before the change, 
I was able to run 1 report for each of these shippers each week, a total of 3 reports.  Because the new 
report does not give me month-to-date totals I now have to run a report for each shipper for each gas day, 
a total of 21 reports each week.  It is very time consuming to run and analyze all these reports.  As 
Marketing does more of these sort of deals the volume will only grow. 

It is critical that I get a report that gives me month-to-date totals so I don't have to run a report for each shipper
for each day.  Is there some way you could revise the report to again show the month-to-date totals?

Minor comparisons:

1)  The 2nd portion of the original report had an area where you could quickly glance at either your receipt
           or delivery point totals.  In order to get a break out of receipt and delivery points now, you have to run 1 
           report sorted by receipt point and 1 report by delivery point.

2)	This is very minor, but I also liked the fact that the report was on letter size paper.  All my files have 
            been set up to accomodate that size of report.  I now have to set up new files.


I appreciate any help you can give me in this matter.

Thanks!  


Jan

Loren/Larry, we have been trying to locate a Marketer for Post Rock for some time now.  Post Rock is now our only hold-out that has not signed their extension agreement so that we could send them their Rate Case Refund invoices that are dated 9/1/1999 so becuase of that, all of those invoices are still sitting on our accounts receivable account plus they have not yet paid their Reservation invoices for
Nov. 2000 thru March 2001.  The Market Service Rep (Randy Janzen and Harry Woodson) was going to call them to today to find out why they hadn't paid their Reservation invoices but we may need help from Marketing to see if we can get this extension agreement signed.  Please let me know if you have talked with anyone at Post Rock and if you need anything from our group.

Thanks,

Raetta

Raetta,

	You called with a few questions about Post Rock K# 104759; Larry and/or Loren should be able to assist you.  Post Rock apparently thought this agreement had a one year term.  It seems we amended the deal, unilaterally, to extend their term to 5 years (per note in the Envision file).  You stated that Post Rock has not paid any of their invoices in nearly a year which leads me to believe they consider the deal terminated (are they nominating on this contract?).  Larry or Loren is the Account Manager for Post Rock (both names appear in the file) so they should field your questions.

1.	Mandatory cash-out each month (after netting and option to trade).
2.	Definition of 6 indices (vs. 3 in current tariff).
3.	Parties may mutually agree to cash out PNR.  Could probably do today without this language.
4.	Clarification that PNR may be used by Operators.
5.	May use PNR for ""auto-balancing"".

Proposed in TW's 637 Filing - Could ""Trade""

1.	Daily balancing.  Including daily tolerance, daily auto-transfer to PNR & daily pricing.
2.	Smaller tolerance range.  Proposed change from +/- 10% to +/- 5%.

Laura,
Based on the response received from Sue and TK (below), please remind PNM of the 10,000 Dth PNR balance and ask them to nominate the gas off TW at their earliest convenience. The gas is currently ""parked"" at the Rio Puerco PNR point, POI# 500617. Since the Purchase Order# 27190 expired on 4/30/2000, PNM will have to use their current PNR contract (Cr# 27267).  I have asked Richard Hanagriff to transfer the quantities from PO# 27190 to Cr# 27267. 

In your discussions with PNM you might verify that Imbalance Statements should continue to be sent to Sally Prentice at Alvarado Square in Albuquerque, NM. (TW has been sending an imbalance statement on this 10,000 Dth to Sally each month)  

If you have any questions, please call me.

I would recommend that we just have them nominate it out when it is convenient for TW and not charge them any additional fees.  Is there a procedure in place that will prevent us from missing a balance like this again?

In analyzing shipper imbalance statements, Laura Giambrone discovered a PNR balance of 10,000 Dth on the above noted contract. The balance was parked on TW on April 26, 2000 and PNM paid a $0.03 per Dth/d fee in that month . TW has not billed PNR fees on the balance since May 1, 2000. PNM has not inquired about nor nominated the redelivery of the quantities held by TW.
How should this matter be handled?

As you are aware,  NNG has reached a settlement with the shippers in the SLA proceeding.  Part of the settlement provides that NNG and its shippers will work together in good faith to develop an imbalance resolution which includes a shipper option of in-kind balancing or cash out.  Also, the working group would define the parameters around which NNG could buy or sell gas into or out of the operational storage account.  Mary Kay has asked that Steve Kirk & myself co-chair this committee for NNG and that the two of you also be members of the committee on behalf of NNG.  I assume you are OK with this assignment.

We would like to get together and discuss our general approach to this effort.  Steve and I think our initial meeting could be held in the Video Conference room.    Could you let me know your availability to get together sometime next week for appr 1 -1/12 hours?

I will then try to coordinate a meeting of the group and probably include Mary Kay and possibly Dave Neubauer.

Let me know.

Mike,

Kent and Tim called me this morning and said that they have received a letter from LS Power requesting compensation for costs they feel they incurred to adjust their supply due to cuts on their FDD overrun.  Their analysis applies to the period June 1, 2001 to present.  Kent and Tim need data to perform an analysis that will be used to respond to LS Power's (USES) request.

Kent has requested the following for the period June 1 forward:

A list of days where at least one cycle was not allocated (in other words, if we allocated one or more cycles of a gas day, but not every cycle (regardless of which cycle was not allocated), they need an electronic list of those days. 
 Electronic copies of each of your final month end sum sheets for June forward.

They want to answer the customer within a week, so they'll need this information at least by early next week.  Kent has requested that all of the information be sent to both him and Tim.

Thanks for your help!

Kent and Tim,

Here are the gas daily prices at demarc that you requested.  Mike is working on incorporating the daily allocation data in each sum sheet for June forward, and he will provide you that information as soon as possible.

Please let me know if you need further details from me.

Lynn/Karen:
 
The November 1 termination of the reverse auction point on Northern will increase the probability of priority mismatches at Aberdeen and Welcome between our two systems.  
 
We have already received questions asking how we will confirm these points after the 1st.  And our response has been that we would expect the restricting party to dictate who can and cannot flow at these locations.  
 
One party that has been surprisingly quiet so far has been Mirant.   Mirant should be very interested in how we will allocate capacity at these two points on November 1, simply because their contracts have the greatest risk of not being scheduled.  They are the only firm shipper on Northern Border that have Aberdeen and Welcome as contracted path end points.  And as you know, they supplied the reverse auction point.   But from what we have heard on the street, they are not actively matching up their supply with those markets who were allocated reverse auction capacity on your system.  That is why I feel the odds are high for a capacity mismatch.
 
Mirant does have a couple of options with their Welcome contract on Border; they can drop some of their Welcome gas off at a secondary upstream point, such as Marshall.  But their Aberdeen contract needs to flow at either Aberdeen or Warner on our system.  And if their capacity is stranded at Aberdeen on the 1st, I am confident that they will be giving both of us a call.  
 
Between Aberdeen and Warner (our alternate delivery point to NWPS), we have the ability to deliver into this area an aggregate of over 70 MMcf/d.  If we do see firm and interruptible gas nominated into these points in excess of this amount, I feel Northern Border must zero out the interruptibles on our side - that was the issue that created so much heart burn for Pan Alberta years ago when we were forced to allocate Ventura.  But that is as far as we are planning to go.   We view the flow restriction to be on your side.  And we are suggesting that your priorities be used to allocate Aberdeen on the 1st. 
 
If we do a firm allocation based on Border's priorities before we confirm, we would have a definite mismatch, and potentially nothing would be scheduled at the point.  Now that would not be all bad, given that we could use such an opportunity to deliver off the large OBA imbalance gas due NNG at the point.  But I don't think we want to fire up a battle with the shippers on both sides of the fence; we'll deal with Mirant on our end.  
 
As for the Aberdeen OBA imbalance issue, I am still trying to come up with a long term solution to deal with that situation.  Any ideas as to how we can effectively eliminate the imbalance would be greatly appreciated, especially given the fact that the Energy Affiliate NOPR suggests that the flexibility we may have today could be restricted in the future.

Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

I have spoken with Williams, and two representatives will be here Monday at 9:00 AM. Frank Billings and Greg Pointer are the two gentlemen that will be visiting us and they will have the reception desk call John when they get here.

As mentioned, their main interest is going to be how we manage the commercial transactions of the MOPS asset for NNG as well as our joint venture partners.  They will also be interested in discussing the interim service agreement and what services we will be able provide.  They have not provided us enough information to date to develop a definitive agreement, but after this visit they should be in a position specify what they need us to do. The physical operations of the asset is currently contracted to Enron Operations, LP, and that contract can be assigned by NNG to Williams.  It is possible they may have questions regarding the billing and allocation of the operating cost, and if so Betty Jamison may be able to provide insight on those.

Thanks for your help,

Kent and Tim,

Attached are Excel workbooks for the Storage Summary months of June through October, 2001. On the summary sheet of each workbook, in Columns BC - BG is a matrix depicting which nomination cycles were allocated and which were not.

In a separate Excel workbook I pasted a column of dates onto the LSPower2001Analysis file I received earlier from and used bold lettering and shading ti identify the dates where NO allocations were performed. 

I hope this is data you art looking for. If I can provide additional information, let me know.  I will be out of the office on Monday and Tuesday, Oct. 22 & 23, returning on Wednesday Oct. 24th.

Hi Lynn, I worked through lunch Friday so that I could leave at 4 sorry I missed you.  Attached will be the insert for the Nutcraker Invitation.  Shelley would like for me to get these out ASAP so I just wanted to get your approval on the insert.  Are there any changes you would like for me to make??  Because of paper format you will need to scroll down.  Also will Sheila, Shelley and yourself be taking their own vehicle or would you like for me to rent a van big enough for everyone to be in one group??

 

Thanks,
Ava"

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
	FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION

Texas Gas Transmission Corporation   				Docket No.
RP01-278-002
                                                      
	NOTICE OF COMPLIANCE FILING

	(October 22, 2001)

Take notice that on October 17, 2001, Texas Gas Transmission Corporation
(Texas Gas) tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, First
Revised Volume No. 1, the  following tariff sheets to become effective
October 1, 2001:

                                Primary
                                Third Revised Sheet No. 181
                                Third Revised Sheet No. 182
                                Third Revised Sheet No. 183
                                Sheet No. 184 (reserved)
                                Second Revised Sheet No. 185
                                
                                Alternate
                                Alternate Third Revised Sheet No. 181
                                Alternate Third Revised Sheet No. 182
                                Alternate Third Revised Sheet No. 183
                                
Texas Gas states that this filing is being submitted in compliance with the
Commission's Order issued on September 19, 2001 in the above-referenced
docket.  As directed, the tariff sheets removed  the daily  high/low index
price for cash-out.  In response, Texas Gas proposes to establish a
cash-out price based on a weekly high/low index price determined from the
weeks within the applicable month, plus the first week of the following
month.  The primary and alternate sheets require in-kind make-up  of
imbalances up to 2% and use the same index price  for  imbalances  above
5%.
However,  the primary sheets also propose to eliminate cash-out for all
imbalances up to  5%  by also requiring a mandatory in-kind make-up level
from 2% to 5% and by eliminating any use of the 100% price index for this
tier of imbalance.

Texas Gas states that copies of  the revised  tariff sheets are being mailed
to Texas  Gas's  jurisdictional customers and interested state commissions.

Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 888 First Street, N.E., Washington,
D.C. 20426, in accordance with Section 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and
Regulations.  All such protests must be filed in accordance with Section
154.210 of the Commission's Regulations.  Protests will be considered by the
Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not
serve to make protestants parties to the proceedings.  Copies of this filing
are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.
This filing may also be viewed on the web at http://www.ferc.gov using the
""RIMS"" link, select ""Docket#"" and follow the instructions  (call
202-208-2222 for assistance).  Comments, protests and interventions may be
filed electronically via the Internet in lieu of paper.  See, 18 CFR
385.2001(a)(1)(iii) and the instructions on the Commission's web site under
the ""e-Filing"" link.

The charts from these locations are not received in time to process for the 5th work day close, so these daily volumes are determined systematically based on the beginning and ending index readings. Even if they were, it is impossible to determine daily volume consumption from a 31day chart. Even decreasing the chart rotation is not a solution unless charts are received by the third work day to allow sufficient time for processing. The answer is to install EFM or possibly a Bullhorn unit to determine the actual daily index readings so that the daily quantities are accurately determined.. On these types of installations, how can we assess penalties on anything other than monthly quantities ? NNG has several locations where the existing equipment does not meet today's business needs, so we probably need to determine where these deficiencies exists, and identify the costs to resolve the problem.
Thanks-
Gary

Gary, was wondering if you could help us out. Scott has told me that they have 31 day charts for the stations listed below and he was wondering why we couldn't read those so as to get daily volumes rather than taking the total for the month and dividing it by the number of days in the month to get the daily volume.  The reason for this is because, especially in the winter time, this can become very crucial when we calculate the penalty invoices which are done daily and are based on the differences between the daily physical volumes and the volumes that the shippers have scheduled on our pipe.  If these charts cannot be read daily, what can we do to make it so that they can. Could you please check to find out what we need to do in order to have accurate daily volumes for these stations.

Thanks,

Raetta

Thanks for looking into this for me Raetta.  I talked to Jim Banker this week and asked for him to check and see if they were charged for any penalty gas or not.  He said that he would let me know if they had.  He also stressed that we still need to see the actual daily volumes instead of average daily volumes on the volume statements.  I'm not quit sure if this part of the problem has been addressed yet or not.  Please let me know. Thanks Scott

I have looked at the DDVC invoices for Midwest for March, 2001 which total $304.70.  The SMS charges amount to $76.30 but the biggest part of the invoice is the negative DDVC charge which is for $228.40  - this occurred on March 26.  I was wondering if the Midwest Natural Gas people could let us know what they think the volumes should be on those specific wells that they are concerned about for the 26th and then if necessary, we could make those corrections.  Please let me know if there is anything else that I can do to help.

Thanks,

Raetta

Subject:	Daily Volumes For Midwest Natural Gas

I recently met with Jim Banker with Midwest Natural Gas from Whitehall, Wi.  He informed me that he had some concerns about whether or not he was being charged for penalty gas for daily volumes.  He showed me some gas volume statements that he recieved from GMS.  I believe it was the month of March Statement.  What the statement showed is average daily volumes instead of the actual volumes per day. (Ex. At  Eleva TBS Days 1 and 2 showed 122 MCF and Days 3-31  showed 118 MCF.)  These are charted stations with 31 day charts.  The stations that he is concerned about are Arcadia, Eleva, Independance, Mondovi, Strum, Whitehall #1,and  Whitehall #3.  Any assistance or knowledge that you can provide me would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks Scott 612-270-8501

Lynn,

I was ask to make a selection between Amy and Christine to do testing for the  new accounting project. Which will take up to 50% of their time away from the team. My recommendation to you and Rick Dietz was Christine McEvoy to be the selected individual to test on this project. If you have any concerns on this matter please let me know. Thank you. 

One more thing, could we mention this in the next team leader meeting for all the individuals involved in this testing.

Jean, as part of an April, 2000 meeting, Alliant expressed concern as to why they had just received a $43,000 accounts receivable package dating back to 1995.  Bill Cordes promised Northern would look into the receivables and Market Services was to work with WP&L to clear.  Before Marketing would consider approving a write-off, please furnish an update of Gas Logistics' discussions with WP&L and either the progress towards payment/resolution or WP&L's position. 

Thank you.

Chris:

Per out conversation a few weeks ago,  I'm attaching WP&L's Spreadsheet showing
""ALL"" Contracts, DDVC and Imbalance invoices outstanding.
 << File: WPL_AR_JBRB_22500_102201.xls >> 

As you will note this is the same spreadsheet that accompanied the packet to WP&L,
no data has changed.   Its been sometime but perhaps you might have archived the
packet that I forwarded to you at that time, it did include the invoices as well as the
spreadsheet.   Also, see the last page of the Spreadsheet which gives you a breakout
total for each category (Contracts,DDVC and Imbalance) for writeoff.

Also, attached is the Writeoff Agreement Form with a brief explanation and the
required approval signatures.   Perhaps the  explanation is not the appropriate verbage,
I certainly do welcome you editing if this does not meet with your approval.


 << File: WP&L_WRITEOFF_SEBESTA_1997_98_98_10_22_01.doc >> 
WP&L's Current Business is clean, if this historical business is approved for write-off,
we will then have a complete clean slate with WP&L.   Chris, I wished I had a better
option, however as soon as you have had an opportunity to review and digest the attached
informaton, I'll be happy to discuss at your earliest convenience if we need further
 clarification of the spreadsheet or the approval form.

FYI,  Frank & Courtney,  this is a correspondence that Raetta has received from Gary Anderson (GMS).  The subject of this correspondence is for all practical purposes the same issues that we are facing with MidAmerican.  This may help you prepare for our conference call with Gary.  Any question please give me a call.  		j.  floyd

The charts from these locations are not received in time to process for the 5th work day close, so these daily volumes are determined systematically based on the beginning and ending index readings. Even if they were, it is impossible to determine daily volume consumption from a 31day chart. Even decreasing the chart rotation is not a solution unless charts are received by the third work day to allow sufficient time for processing. The answer is to install EFM or possibly a Bullhorn unit to determine the actual daily index readings so that the daily quantities are accurately determined.. On these types of installations, how can we assess penalties on anything other than monthly quantities ? NNG has several locations where the existing equipment does not meet today's business needs, so we probably need to determine where these deficiencies exists, and identify the costs to resolve the problem.
Thanks-
Gary

Gary, was wondering if you could help us out. Scott has told me that they have 31 day charts for the stations listed below and he was wondering why we couldn't read those so as to get daily volumes rather than taking the total for the month and dividing it by the number of days in the month to get the daily volume.  The reason for this is because, especially in the winter time, this can become very crucial when we calculate the penalty invoices which are done daily and are based on the differences between the daily physical volumes and the volumes that the shippers have scheduled on our pipe.  If these charts cannot be read daily, what can we do to make it so that they can. Could you please check to find out what we need to do in order to have accurate daily volumes for these stations.

Thanks,

Raetta

Thanks for looking into this for me Raetta.  I talked to Jim Banker this week and asked for him to check and see if they were charged for any penalty gas or not.  He said that he would let me know if they had.  He also stressed that we still need to see the actual daily volumes instead of average daily volumes on the volume statements.  I'm not quit sure if this part of the problem has been addressed yet or not.  Please let me know. Thanks Scott

I have looked at the DDVC invoices for Midwest for March, 2001 which total $304.70.  The SMS charges amount to $76.30 but the biggest part of the invoice is the negative DDVC charge which is for $228.40  - this occurred on March 26.  I was wondering if the Midwest Natural Gas people could let us know what they think the volumes should be on those specific wells that they are concerned about for the 26th and then if necessary, we could make those corrections.  Please let me know if there is anything else that I can do to help.

Thanks,

Subject:	Daily Volumes For Midwest Natural Gas

I recently met with Jim Banker with Midwest Natural Gas from Whitehall, Wi.  He informed me that he had some concerns about whether or not he was being charged for penalty gas for daily volumes.  He showed me some gas volume statements that he recieved from GMS.  I believe it was the month of March Statement.  What the statement showed is average daily volumes instead of the actual volumes per day. (Ex. At  Eleva TBS Days 1 and 2 showed 122 MCF and Days 3-31  showed 118 MCF.)  These are charted stations with 31 day charts.  The stations that he is concerned about are Arcadia, Eleva, Independance, Mondovi, Strum, Whitehall #1,and  Whitehall #3.  Any assistance or knowledge that you can provide me would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks Scott 612-270-8501

Well, it's Mid October and I am checking on the status of the SBA Priority during Allocations.  The new contracts are due to take effect November 1, 2001, and with cold weather already on the horizon we could be headed for the same types of problems we had last  winter.

Do you have an estimated time of implementation?  Let me know if there is anything else I can do to help.

Thank you for your help.

I have worked up the requirements and the TMS IT group is evaluating the changes.  Due to the CMS implementation we would not be able to implement this change.  The earliest we might be able to implement is Mid to late October.  If you have any questions please call.  Thank you.

Reyna,  this is to confirm that the SBA-TI's should be scheduled after primary but before all other nominations.  sjk

Steve,
Back in June we discussed the issue of the SBAs' priority during an Allocation.  The Business Development group and Contracts are in the process of making the necessary changes so that CMS can distinguish ITs associated with SBA activity from other IT agreements and are second through the meter after Primary during allocations.  For your information, below are the comments from the various people involved in this issue

Please let us know if you have any further concerns regarding this issue.  Thanks for your continued help in this matter.

I believe Reyna, et al, have held discussions with the Reg Types and received the green light to go forward, but I will confirm. 

Regarding (2.), With the new contract system being developed, the monitoring of contract provisions via the system should be do-able. I am sure both CMS and TMS will be involved in the effort.

Sue, 
During the meeting today with Gerry to discuss the SBA priority during allocations, some of the following issues came up:  (Gerry, correct me if I misunderstood anything)

If we ever call an SBA to bring in gas after the timely cycle, do we still want them to have priority over Alternate and Interruptible? (my opinion is no, they should only have this priority during the timely cycle).
If the SBAs bring in gas at a secondary point, do we still want them to have priority over Alternate and Interruptible?  (my opinion is no, they should only have this priority at Primary Points).
Are we aware that an Alternate shipper who has flowing rights from the previous day might get ""squeezed"" out of the same entitlement on a day that an SBA shipper is given priority over Alternate?  Might have some mad shippers.
How will SBA volumes be posted on the EBB if there is an allocation: Interruptible???
Because the current methodology for allocation is based on a ""point"", they don't follow the downstream, will the IT contracts currently being used have to be identified through the contracts department as ""SBA IT""?
This is for the future contracts system:  Should we ask that the new contract system to automate all the manual processes of the SBAs such as account balance and carryover days in order for the system to be able to validate this criteria?

Caroline Barnes has indicated that you have a presentation put together that briefly covers the purpose and function of  Gas Logistics, and how this department  interacts with other departments. I was wondering if you would be interested in making the presentation to GMS personnel to better understand how Measurement impacts your department. Please let me know if you have an interest and when you might be available and  I'll arrange for the conference room to be available.
Thanks-

Not that I'm aware of....Gerry asked for an example, in response on Wednesday concerning how a nomination would look, but I'm not aware of any responses back to him. I have a call into Gerry and I am getting ready to send him a nomination example, just in case he didn't get one.

Well, it's Mid October and I am checking on the status of the SBA Priority during Allocations.  The new contracts are due to take effect November 1, 2001, and with cold weather already on the horizon we could be headed for the same types of problems we had last  winter.

Do you have an estimated time of implementation?  Let me know if there is anything else I can do to help.

Thank you for your help.

I have worked up the requirements and the TMS IT group is evaluating the changes.  Due to the CMS implementation we would not be able to implement this change.  The earliest we might be able to implement is Mid to late October.  If you have any questions please call.  Thank you.

Steve,
Back in June we discussed the issue of the SBAs' priority during an Allocation.  The Business Development group and Contracts are in the process of making the necessary changes so that CMS can distinguish ITs associated with SBA activity from other IT agreements and are second through the meter after Primary during allocations.  For your information, below are the comments from the various people involved in this issue

Please let us know if you have any further concerns regarding this issue.  Thanks for your continued help in this matter.

I believe Reyna, et al, have held discussions with the Reg Types and received the green light to go forward, but I will confirm. 

Regarding (2.), With the new contract system being developed, the monitoring of contract provisions via the system should be do-able. I am sure both CMS and TMS will be involved in the effort.

The Envision System will be down beginning Friday, October 26th at 5:00pm and will remain unavailable for use until Sunday, October 28th, 2001 at 8:00 am 
This is being done to comply with the scheduled building power outage performed by TrizecHahn Office Properties. 
The Three Allen Center Building, where the Envision equipment is located, has scheduled their annual building electrical shutdown on October 27, 2001. 
The shutdown is required to perform preventive maintenance on the main switchgear and any necessary repairs to electrical panels, bus ducts, equipment, etc. 
Access to the building will not be allowed during this power outage.

As discussed in our morning meeting the other day, NNG has a few points that have been approved as points that could potentially have daily capacity (capacity available for some time frame less than 30 days) throughout this winter.  The attached file shows the points and the volume level that have been approved as points which may have daily capacity.  As long as the amount of daily capacity that is determined to be available is within the points/volumes listed on this report, Omaha Planning will be able to post the capacity on our daily capacity report for 1 hour then we are able to sell it.  If we exceed the volumes on this file or have capacity at other points, the capacity change will need to be routed for approval.

At this time, we don't have any short term sustainable (capacity available for at least one month but less than 150 consecutive days) to post for this winter.  If anyone is aware of short-term sustainable capacity that needs to be posted, please let me know.

As changes are made to this list, I will forward them on to you.  Beginning November 1, this posting (without the items in blue type) will be on our website.  Finalized posting procedures for NNG will be completed by Michele Winckowski and forwarded to everyone.  Please send this email on to the rest of the people on your teams.  Thanks.
Ranelle

An Update from Northern Border Pipeline's
Customer Services and Gas Control Departments

No: 2001-21                                                    Date: October
26, 2001



Web Site Change

On Monday, October 29, the look and feel of Northern Border Pipeline's informational
posting site will officially change.  In addition, the URL tied to the site
will be slightly modified.

The new main URL will be www.nbpl.enron.com (nbpl versus nbp).  We recognize
that it may take a bit of time for this subtle abbreviation change to sink
in.  Consequently, our server has been set up to redirect anyone using the
previous informational posting web address to the new site.  But for those
more detailed URL addresses that have been set up in a browser or portal
site to link directly to information posted in the old site, this changeover
will not be as friendly; be aware that those specific addresses will be retired
along with the old site.

As for the new web site layout, it has been purposely built under a ""simpler
is better"" philosophy.   It will not win any artistic design awards.   But
for the purpose of providing information, we believe that functionality of
an informational posting web site should always overrule show.  We hope that
you will agree.

It also should be noted that the new site design is not totally new and untested;
it closely parallels the solution we implemented earlier this year for Midwestern
Gas Transmission, our sister pipeline company.   So those who have accessed
information recently on MGT should be familiar with the layout.

As always, we are open to suggestions.  Please let us know what you think.

 Ava told me you were on Jury Duty on Monday.  I meant Tuesday, Oct. 30th, if you are that day.  Sorry for the mistake.

We have tenatively scheduled a meeting with Lynn to discuss the problems we are experiencing with Amarillo Natural Gas.  The reason it is tenatively is because Lynn has Jury Duty selection on Monday and if picked, she will not be here...maybe!  

Date: Monday, Oct. 29th
Time: 9:00 am
Place: Lynn's Office

Any questions, please let me know.

I talked to Steve in NNG Gas Control to see why we had such a difference in the PVR Shrink for the 26th.  He is showing the volume for the PVR measured @ 96.7 which would be only a 2,481 difference and make the monthly only 4,654 difference.  I also went out into PGAS and confirmed the volume measured was indeed 96.7 dth.  Apparently we have an issue between PGAS and the TMS system.

I will get with Harry, the PGAS group, and the TMS in the morning to see if we can figure out what is going on.  So please disregard the Bushton Report for the 26th.

There is a problem between PGAS and TMS.  The actual volumes for the 26th are not correct in TMS.  In doing the Bushton PVR report I found that the actual volume in TMS did not match the actual volume in PGAS for the PVR measured.  I then began to look at other points, Spearman, Beaver Co's, etc; and found the same problem existed.

Subject: Maintenance Window-Saturday, Oct 27


While you may have read in the Change Control email sent today from the ETS Solution Center, we have some changes on the 41st floor scheduled for this weekend during the maintenance window.  While we do not expect any problems with this maintenance window, we need to make sure we have a plan in place to not impact the customers. 

This Saturday night,  October 27, starting at 10:30 pm fiber maintenance will be performed in the wiring closet on EB41.  During this maintenance window the jacket that covers and protects the fiber will be pulled back tight and secured.  This fiber connects the 41st floor wiring closet with the server room on 41, where the TMS servers are located.   While we do not expect this maintenance to have any impact, if we do have any issues with the fiber it can be replaced within an estimated 2 hour window.  Outage impact would then be lose of connectivity with the Enron LAN from that server room, therefore TMS would be unavailable.  

At 10:30 pm on Saturday night, Mark Cowley from the server team will contact the HotTap Helpdesk to get approval to start the maintenance window.  The maintenance window will not begin until all processing for the pipelines is complete.  If we have any problems or issues he will contact me and I will start the escalation process.    

If you have any questions, please feel free to give me a call.   Thanks.  Jean x51615

This adjustment will result in approximately $7800 in additional revenues.  

One way to prevent this situation in the future would be for the rep and or myself to ensure that Duke's rate has been increased when they have alternate deliveries to the border.   If these alternate deliveries exist and the rate has not been increased then the rep needs to bring this situation to the attention of the marketer.

FYI - In working to load rates for the FERC California reporting requirements, it appears that for the last four months Duke Energy T & M contract #27291 has not been billed the incremental fee of $0.06/dth for alternate deliveries to the Cal Border (over and above the base discount negotiated for the contracted primary points).

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Below is a training tip on creating electronic business cards and links to training documents on Windows 2000 and Outlook.   Each week a training tip is added to the documentation, and I will foward on as new topics are added.  

I would be happy to do brown bag training sessions at lunch or as time permits on topics of interest.   If you have any questions or would like me to setup a session, please give me a call.   Thanks.  Jean x51615

Business cards are a great way to share information about yourself and your company when you want to network with others such as clients, businesses, vendors, and so on.  But if you are communicating via email, what do you do? A handy solution is electronic business cards, called vCards (virtual business cards), which you can send and receive in e-mail using Outlook  Many other e-mail and personal information manager (PIM) applications can use vCards as well, not just Outlook. For more information on vCards, visit the Internet Mail Consortium at http://www.imc.org/pdi/vcardoverview.html
Note: vCards are not needed when communicating with fellow employees, since we already have access to the Outlook address book and Peoplefinder. 
Settings Up Your vCard

1)  Verify Your Information
	- Open the address book ( )
	- Find and select your name
	- Double-click your name or click Properties
	- Is your information correct and complete?  If not, update it in eHRonline or contact your HR rep. 
2)  Create an AutoSignature with your vCard
	- Close any open messages
	- Click Tools, Options, Mail Format, Signature Picker
	- Click New and then type ""vCard"" for the name
	- Click Next and then click New vCard from Contact
	- Find and select your name, then click Add ->, OK 
	- Under the vCard Options section, change it from <None> to your name
	- Click OK, OK, Cancel  (make sure you click cancel or your vCard will be on every email you create)
Good job!  Your vCard is setup and ready to go. 

Sending an E-mail with your vCard
	
	- Create a new e-mail
	- Click Insert, Signature, vCard to insert your vCard 
	- Send your e-mail 

Receiving a vCard via E-mail

If someone outside the company sends you a vCard, how do you quickly add it to your Contacts folder?

	- Double-click on the vCard icon in the e-mail (this will bring up the new contact properties)
	- Add any additional information you wish
	- Click Save and Close

Lynn,

Just to let you know that one of the imbalances that kicked out I did figure it out(believe it or not);I have run nominated reports and scheduled quantities reports for all of Axia's contracts so that Kathy and myself can look at those on Monday to make sure everything looks alright.

The final for 10/27 I was able to figure out and everything was fine.  I will get this ""final"" down if it kills me!

Subject: Final AM Process for 10/26/01


John,
Karen asked me to send you a note about the problems we encountered 
with the final AM processing for 10/26.

When Karen submitted the rollover for the first time, it kicked out
two imbalances.  One, she was able to figure out with Kathy's help
and the other one she cannot.

The shipper on  K# 62418 nom 78172  at Demarc to K# 22252 during the ID2 cycle.
They were scheduled at 75177.
Shipper K# 22252 modified his gas from Demarc (from K#62418) to different storage.
However, he re-nom at the full 78172, not the amount that was scheduled from ID2,
which was 75177.  Shipper K# 62418 did not make any changes to this package.

If we just looked at the nom screen , everything is tied out.
However, we have to consider what's was scheduled.  In this case,
the scheduled number for K#62418 did not match the final am nomination
on K#22252.

After this transaction was invalidated (K#22252), the system
kicks out another imbalance, since K#22252 was realigning storage
gas to K# 22319, and we did not invalidate that change.

Karen also had some problems with not seeing the apply button.
I think Kathy walked her through the process since I did not.
We restarted the final AM process after the Timely allocation
and completed the cycle around 2pm.

Please call if you have questions/concerns.
Thanks,
Joe"

I believe this generated $75 worth of discretion with Midwest Gas.  Unless I am not seeing something here, I don't feel as though investing dollars to install EFM or Bullhorn would be a good idea.

Subject:	RE: Daily Volumes For Midwest Natural Gas

The charts from these locations are not received in time to process for the 5th work day close, so these daily volumes are determined systematically based on the beginning and ending index readings. Even if they were, it is impossible to determine daily volume consumption from a 31day chart. Even decreasing the chart rotation is not a solution unless charts are received by the third work day to allow sufficient time for processing. The answer is to install EFM or possibly a Bullhorn unit to determine the actual daily index readings so that the daily quantities are accurately determined.. On these types of installations, how can we assess penalties on anything other than monthly quantities ? NNG has several locations where the existing equipment does not meet today's business needs, so we probably need to determine where these deficiencies exists, and identify the costs to resolve the problem.
Thanks-
Gary

Gary, was wondering if you could help us out. Scott has told me that they have 31 day charts for the stations listed below and he was wondering why we couldn't read those so as to get daily volumes rather than taking the total for the month and dividing it by the number of days in the month to get the daily volume.  The reason for this is because, especially in the winter time, this can become very crucial when we calculate the penalty invoices which are done daily and are based on the differences between the daily physical volumes and the volumes that the shippers have scheduled on our pipe.  If these charts cannot be read daily, what can we do to make it so that they can. Could you please check to find out what we need to do in order to have accurate daily volumes for these stations.

Thanks,

Raetta

Thanks for looking into this for me Raetta.  I talked to Jim Banker this week and asked for him to check and see if they were charged for any penalty gas or not.  He said that he would let me know if they had.  He also stressed that we still need to see the actual daily volumes instead of average daily volumes on the volume statements.  I'm not quit sure if this part of the problem has been addressed yet or not.  Please let me know. Thanks Scott

I have looked at the DDVC invoices for Midwest for March, 2001 which total $304.70.  The SMS charges amount to $76.30 but the biggest part of the invoice is the negative DDVC charge which is for $228.40  - this occurred on March 26.  I was wondering if the Midwest Natural Gas people could let us know what they think the volumes should be on those specific wells that they are concerned about for the 26th and then if necessary, we could make those corrections.  Please let me know if there is anything else that I can do to help.

Thanks,

Subject:	Daily Volumes For Midwest Natural Gas

I recently met with Jim Banker with Midwest Natural Gas from Whitehall, Wi.  He informed me that he had some concerns about whether or not he was being charged for penalty gas for daily volumes.  He showed me some gas volume statements that he recieved from GMS.  I believe it was the month of March Statement.  What the statement showed is average daily volumes instead of the actual volumes per day. (Ex. At  Eleva TBS Days 1 and 2 showed 122 MCF and Days 3-31  showed 118 MCF.)  These are charted stations with 31 day charts.  The stations that he is concerned about are Arcadia, Eleva, Independance, Mondovi, Strum, Whitehall #1,and  Whitehall #3.  Any assistance or knowledge that you can provide me would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks Scott 612-270-8501

Subject: Bushton Balance through 10-26-01 - UPDATE - Please disregard
previous Bushton Report for 26th!


I talked to Steve in NNG Gas Control to see why we had such a difference
in the PVR Shrink for the 26th.  He is showing the volume for the PVR
measured @ 96.7 which would be only a 2,481 difference and make the
monthly only 4,654 difference.  I also went out into PGAS and confirmed
the volume measured was indeed 96.7 dth.  Apparently we have an issue
between PGAS and the TMS system.

I will get with Harry, the PGAS group, and the TMS in the morning to see
if we can figure out what is going on.  So please disregard the Bushton
Report for the 26th.

These notes are very high level.
The goals of Brads meeting was to evaluate the need for the development of a systems diagnostic tool and to develop a process for notification of critical business application and hardware failure. This was a follow up meeting where alternate forms of communicating with customers was discussed. 
Critical Business Application:
Outlook (Exchange Servers)
Mailman.Enron.com
Websites / Servers (all the www.hottap.enron.com there are eight in total)
EDI Hub
EDI Net
VPN
PGas
TMS
CMS
CRS
 	
Set up a process for notification of outages and customer notification:
Scott Abshire felt Blackberry would be very beneficial for internal communication due to the ability to send direct messages to one another inside the building.
Develop three methods for communicating (Email, Page and voice mail, Pop Up messaging).
Outage and failure communications to go to the HotTap Help Desk, Shelley, Directors and Team Advisors.
Outage and failure communication messages to be distributed from either the Help Desk or Jean McFarland.
EDI possibly could be rolled into the same communication method.

Scott Abshrie and his group are all ready planned and budgeted a diagnostic tool, the first phase is for hardware and will be functional by yearend 2001. The second phase will be for applications in in service sometime in 2002. With this plan in place there is no need to duplicate efforts.

Caroline Barnes has indicated that you have a presentation put together that briefly covers the purpose and function of  Gas Logistics, and how this department  interacts with other departments. I was wondering if you would be interested in making the presentation to GMS personnel to better understand how Measurement impacts your department. Please let me know if you have an interest and when you might be available and  I'll arrange for the conference room to be available.
Thanks-

In talking to Terry Kolwalke and Jodie Floyd apparently there is a timing issue between the two systems and this caused the problem.  There were some other measurement issues related to Bushton and they reran the numbers and cleared up these problems.

Subject:	Actual Volumes in TMS for October 26th

There is a problem between PGAS and TMS.  The actual volumes for the 26th are not correct in TMS.  In doing the Bushton PVR report I found that the actual volume in TMS did not match the actual volume in PGAS for the PVR measured.  I then began to look at other points, Spearman, Beaver Co's, etc; and found the same problem existed.

To all reps, when filling out the Morning Gas Control Report to record on voice mail. Make sure that you start asking what the percentage is daily for the Carlton Resolution. As it is very important to get the proper percentage updated in TMS to be posted to the EBB. The North End Reps are the ones responsible for updating this by 9 AM daily to make sure it is posted to the EBB 48 hours prior to gas flow. The season starts Nov. 1, 2001 and runs through March 31, 2002.  On the attached form highlighted in yellow is where the information goes. If you questions or concerns regarding this please see Nancy Callans or myself. Thank you.

			Caroline Barnes has indicated that you have a presentation put together that briefly covers the purpose and function of  Gas Logistics, and how this department  interacts with other departments. I was wondering if you would be interested in making the presentation to GMS personnel to better understand how Measurement impacts your department. Please let me know if you have an interest and when you might be available and  I?ll arrange for the conference room to be available.

Lynn & Raetta,  In a conference call with Frank Semin, Courtney Barker, Gary Anderson and Ellis Stern today it was discussed on how the end of the month volumes have been estimated in the past dealing with 16 and 31 days charts.  Also, it was discussed on how this affects DDVC and other penalties that are billed from a Gas Logistics perspective.  Frank is needing to respond to MidAmerican on how NNG actualizes daily volume at their untelemetered (chart/index) end user points.  Frank would like to schedule a meeting with Gas Logistics, Marketing (Dave Neubauer), GMS (Gary Anderson, Ellis Stern) to discuss the end user agreements and the procedures that GMS uses when determining actual flow at the end user points.  Frank wants all parties within ETS to be aware of some to the issue involved in this process.  

Lynn & Raetta,  could you schedule some time to discuss.  I would like to bring you up to speed on the previous conversations and calls that I have had with Marketing, MidAmerican and GMS on this subject. 

I will be out of the office on Wed and Fri. this week if that helps.  I'm pretty flexible other than that.   Give me a call if you have any questions

Hey Theresa and Lynn.  I just wanted to say that I really enjoyed getting
to know you two last week and that I hope we can stay in contact.  I
typically just meet Regulatory people in my circle so it's good to know
people who actually know how their pipeline operates!  Lynn - I think I am
finally getting the hang of operating those earrings.  That Tuesday morning
when we were leaving San Fran. the little dangle got cock-eyed and I
couldn't get the earring out to fix it.  At some point at the airport I
managed to get it out.  Am much better now.  Take care and hope to see both
of you soon.

Payables

Effective today, the responsibility for Accounts Payables has been moved to Global Strategic Sourcing under the leadership of George Wasaff.  He, along with the Accounts Payable team, is pleased to announce a number of system enhancements based on your valuable feedback.

Delegation of Authority 
iPayit now enables you to identify a delegate to code, review, or approve invoices on your behalf.  The system provides you with the flexibility to:
*  Identify a delegate as a coder, approver, or reviewer
*  Define the length of time that you would like to delegate your authority
*  Select whether the delegate will assume your approval amount, maintain their own approval amount, or assume a specific approval amount

Incorrect Company Code
Incorrect company code?  No problem!  The invoice will no longer return to Accounts Payable for correction before you are able to code the invoice.  iPayit enables you to select the correct company code and continue coding.

Additional Enhancements
*  In addition to Quick Forward, you can now Quick Approve invoices
*  Invoice comments can now be easily viewed from your in-box

Introducing iPayit
With so many new systems, you told us that it was easy to confuse Payables with iBuyit eProcurement.  To help clear up that confusion, we are pleased to announce that this new and improved version has a new name:  iPayit.  
*  To access iPayit, visit the iBuyit Portal or http://iPayit.enron.com.
*  Look for e-mail notifications from <mailto:ipayit@enron.com>.  

Sneak Peak
For a preview of the enhancements and how to use them, click on the link below:
http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/ipayitsyspres.ppt

This is just the beginning!  We have created a committee that is dedicated to improving the Accounts Payable process.  We hope to engage you in this effort and plan to actively seek your involvement and input.  We look forward to working with and hearing from you about future enhancements that will enable iPayit to play a valuable role in your invoice payment activities.

For invoice payment status please call the AP Call Center at (713) 853-7127 or toll free  (866) AP ENRON, or send an e-mail to <mailto:ipayit@enron.com>.

Effective today, you will notice many iPayit improvements.  iPayit is Enron's tool to code and approve invoices.  Your feedback has directly driven these changes, and the iPayit team and your business unit representatives are continuing to identify and prioritize future system enhancements.

Resolution Type
iPayit inbox now displays updated invoice status once all coding has been applied to the invoice.  The resolution type will display ""Needs Approval"".

""On Hold"" Status Information
The reason a transaction is on hold and the expected resolution date can be viewed by hovering your cursor over the ""On Hold"" icon.

Improved Search Functions
* Streamlined search for Tax Jurisdiction Codes by entering one or more data points with fewer clicks.  You are no longer required to enter all four search criteria.
* New search boxes to generate Material Numbers and Descriptions and Functional Area Numbers and Descriptions.  You will no longer see the drop down boxes with truncated information. 

Advanced G/L Account Coding Combinations
You now have the ability to enter Balance Sheet Accounts 2, 3 series and Revenue/COGS Accounts 50, 51 series in invoice line item coding.

I will be on vacation until July 9th. If you need to talk to me, try 605-272-5680. If no answer, try 605-272-5296. Cell phones and pagers don't work too good up there. I will be checking my voice and e:mails in the evenings, probably after 10:00 pm. sj"

Here are my flight arrangements.  I'm flying back on Tuesday because the flights on Monday evening get back very late.  With the distance and the 2-hour time difference, it takes 6 hours on the clock to get home.

Pamela,
I have 6 electronic tickets that were issued for travel on Continental on
September 26 through the 28th, 2001.  These travelers were to attend the
Southern Gas Association (SGA) Energy Accounting and Marketing Services
Conference in New Orleans.  Due to the Terrorist attacks, the conference was
cancelled.  I realize the date 9/26/01 falls outside the deadline for
allowing re-issuance of tickets with non-refundable fares without penalty or
administrative fee.  However, these Enron employees have asked me to
approach Continental on their behalf and request that their tickets be
re-issued to attend the conference on its rescheduled dates (January 16-18,
2002) without penalty.  I will be happy to supply a copy of the
cancellation/reschedule notice sent out by conference director, or any other
supporting documentation that might suffice.

The six travelers/ticket numbers/prices are as follows:
BLAIR/GRACE LYNN / 005-7033562204 / $136.30
CALLANS/NANCY / 005-7033562205 / $136.30
MCDANIAL/JANET / 005-7033562232 / $136.30
JOHNSON/ALICE / 005-7033562301 / $136.30
HERNANDEZ/ALBERT / 005-7033562313 / $184.45
HANAGRIFF/RICHARD / 005-7033399204 / $104.75

Thank you in advance for anything you may be able to do to help these Enron
travelers.

All best,
Elizabeth

Sounds great.  I've heard back from Pat that she is planning to make it, and
I've just sent a follow-up to Kathy.  Looking forward to seeing you!

     Sheryl, right now I am planning on coming in Friday night, late since
I could not
     get there Saturday morning.  So hope all works out.  If not I am sure
I can find
     something to do on Saturday.  Thanks. Lynn

   Hi Ladies!

   I think I have now mentioned to all of you that it would be great to get
   together on the Saturday prior to our meeting.  My current thought is to
   have the three of you travel together on the ferry from SF to Marin.  I
   would pick you up and we could visit the wine country for lunch.  Sound
   like
   a plan?

   I'll provide more details later, but here is some important information:
   The ferry leaves from SF at 10:45 a.m. (there are other times, but we
   wouldn't make lunch).

   So, what do you think?  Doable?

Pipeline Interconnect Forum Participants:

We are pleased to inform you that the Sheraton Fisherman's Wharf has agreed
to extend our discounted rate of $199 for the following days:
Friday, October 19
Saturday, October 20
Sunday, October 21
Monday, October 22

As well, the reservation cut-off has been extended until October 18.

We hope this helps people who are either coming in early to enjoy the sights
of San Francisco or those who don't want to take the red-eye flight home on
Monday night.  We are excited about seeing everyone.

Pipeline Interconnect Forum Participants:

PG&E's California Gas Transmission would like to invite you to a meeting to
be held in San Francisco, CA on Monday, October 22, 2001.  We would also
love for you to join us for a welcome lunch and activity on Sunday, October
21.  This will be a lot of fun so plan on flying into San Francisco early if
possible.  (With the airline reliability being what it is, it's a good idea
to arrive prior to Monday morning anyway.)

Here are a few ideas for the agenda:

*	GISB 1.5 - Will the new standards affect your nomination schedules
and processing times?
*	Hourly Scheduling - Is anyone planning to implement this and would
like to perform a demo?
*	Balancing solutions for problems caused by timing issues in the
Intraday 2 cycle.
*	637 Segmentation - How is everybody addressing this?
*	GISB Capacity Release Standard 5.3.2 - possible scheduling issue.
*	Demonstrations of new services being offered by pipelines.
*	Cross Contract Ranking update.
*	Nominations & Contracting Systems best practices/benchmarking.
*	What is our purpose?

Comments regarding these recommended agenda items and other suggestions are
welcome.

For planning purposes, we need to know how many of you will be attending the
meeting, and the Sunday welcoming activity.  Please RSVP by July 30, 2001,
to Todd Hudson tgh4@pge.com <mailto:tgh4@pge.com> for both the meeting and
the Sunday activities.

We're really looking forward to seeing you all again and meeting our new
participants!

Hi Ladies!

I think I have now mentioned to all of you that it would be great to get
together on the Saturday prior to our meeting.  My current thought is to
have the three of you travel together on the ferry from SF to Marin.  I
would pick you up and we could visit the wine country for lunch.  Sound like
a plan?

I'll provide more details later, but here is some important information:
The ferry leaves from SF at 10:45 a.m. (there are other times, but we
wouldn't make lunch).

So, what do you think?  Doable?

Lynn,
Glad you all were able to work that out.  I will add Theresa as an invitee
for Monday and as a substitute for Sunday in case of a cancellation.

I think that the agenda item you suggested will be covered under ""Balancing
solutions for problems caused by timing issues in the Intraday 2 cycle.""  We
want to address how people solve remaining imbalances after ID2 is over.

Looking forward to seeing you all,

	Todd, I am looking forward to the meeting in October as well as
meeting you.  I wanted to let you know
	ETS would like to add one more person to list for the meeting.
Theresa Hess is now in the ETS Gs Logistics
	group and I think it would be beneficial for her to attend.
Please add Theresa on any future emails.  Her
	email address is theresa.hess@enron.com.  In talking with
Sheryl, I think you are all booked up for the
	Sunday activity, but Sheryl put Theresa on the list in case of a
cancellation.

	One topic I wouldl ike to talk about at the meeting:  is the
""mis matches"" across interconnecting
	pipelines at the Intraday 2 cycle.  This is still a concern for
the Enron pipes and I wold like to know
	if anyone has come up with any ""great"" ideas on minimizing these
mismatches.  If you would like
	to discuss further, please call me (713) 853-7637.

	Have a great day and I look forward to seeing you on October 21.
Thanks. Lynn

Please be informed, because a large number of our invitees had conflicting schedules, we are moving the date of our Appreciation Luncheon.  Steve's main objective was to include as many of  ETS' TW Teams as possible.  To achieve this effort, the luncheon will be moved to a date and time which does not conflict with activities within ETS.  

As soon as we confirm our date, we will notify you via email.

Thanks in advance for your patience and understanding.

I would like at host a meeting to discuss new small volume delivery points in the field.  The Business Development group has at least three requests from different entities for new delivery points.  The issues to be discussed at the meeting include type of measurement to be installed at the point, applicability of DDVCs. balancing, OBAs and a host of other issues.  These small volume points take an extraordinary amount of time for many departments and produce a very small amount of revenue for ETS.  Anything that can be done to simplify the process would be a cost benefit to ETS.  

The meeting details are as follows:


	Day			Wednesday
	Date			October 10, 2001
	Time 			3:00 P.M.
	Location		Houston EB 42C2   (relocation of the video conference facilities)
				Omaha 696


I look forward to receiving your input at the meeting.  Please free to forward this meeting notice to anyone you think would like to be involved in this process that I have missed.  Thanks

Attached is the compilation of customer comments from the NNG customer meeting.  I have made a rough attempt at categorizing them.  Many of these concerns were discussed in the process improvement sessions.  There will be follow up meetings to prioritize and address these issues this week.  Please take some time to review these comments.

Attached is the prioritization list of the system enhancements from this morning's meeting.  As we discussed, the estimated timetable to implement these changes will be before the end of the year.  If there are delays in any of these items, whereby a December 30 deadline can't be met,  please let me know ASAP.  We intend to communicate to customers early next year as to our progress on these items and other customer service enhancements.  

In addition, I have attached the first set of FAQ's that will be distributed to customers and posted on the website.

3. Storage allocation should show injection or withdraw allocation in the Batch Schedule Status screen.
4. Provide Scheduled Quantities reports by date range in a format for downloading in to Access database. 
5. GAS in Place is a moving capacity target, needs to be a 24hr number.
6. Cut notice should include the cut code.
7. Previous cycle cut codes do not show up on the final report.
8. Improve phone coverage from 7:30am until noon by CSR.
9. 8am Gas Control meeting interfeers with phone coverage, we should make sure to minimize how many reps. attend the meeting so phones are covered. Customers like assigned CSR.
10. Customers said cut notices are getting out consistantly.Customers would like cut notice by LE. 
11. When are measured volumes final? Water vapor factor is figured at month end and customers should include in there montly calcualtion.

From: Kuehl, Toby 


The presentations have been posted to NNG's ""Download"" Site at <http://www.nng.enron.com/dob/etfr_downloads.html> at the bottom of the page. These presentations will be hard to email due to the size of the them.  My suggestion would be if a customer wants to save the presentations on their PC, the easiest way to do this is:

1. Right mouse click on the presentation link
2. ""Save target as""
3. Pick the directory where you want to save it
4. Click on ""save""

This will download the presentation or presentations they wish to save to their PC.

Joe, Hasan,=20

Just a thought on this issue.......

In light of the concern from the customers that they are not receiving all =
of their cut notices, (which was a major topic up during the NNG winter ops=
 meeting) we need to take a closer look at ""why"" the customers are not rece=
iving them.  Is it the cache, wrong address, e-mail issues etc....  Is ther=
e something we do systematically to assure ourselves that these cut notific=
ations are hitting their destinations?  I realize that once the e-mail is s=
ent we have no control of it and there are times when customers are having =
mail server problems, but I just want to make sure it is at least getting o=
ut of our shop.  Can we make some kind of report that will generate on dema=
nd on what cut notifications were sent during the day?  This way we could s=
ee if they were sent, and if the customer did not receive them, we could lo=
ok at a log file to verify if the cut notifications were generated and sent=
 out via e-mail.  We, meaning Dennis or I do not have the capability to kno=
w exactly what was sent unless we contact you.  Again, this seems to be a m=
ajor concern to the customers.  Let us know if you have any other ideas on =
this matter.

Thx,

Toby

Dennis,
Unfortunately, the database audit trail does not handle deletion very well.
It will log when the record was added and modified.  For deletes,
it only logs that the record was deleted, not when.
I cannot tell whether the entry for Jimmy Knight was deleted prior to the=
=20
running of the process or not.
The only thing I can confirm is that we did send out the email to him
last night after the evening cycle.  This contract was not cut during
the non-grid cycle this morning so no email went out.

However, currently only jmosher and tjones show up  with the shipper cut no=
tices=20
for this contract if it got cut during the Intraday 1 cycle.

To eliminate any doubts, I will change the process to totally recache contr=
act/contacts information
before processing email.

Thanks,
Joe

According to the database audit trail, the contact record for Jimmy Mosher =
was created=20
on 9/13 , 9:11 am.  However , that record did not have an email address on =
it.
This morning, (9/14 9:02 am), this record was modified to include the email=
 address of=20
jmosher@oneok.com.

For Theresa, the original contact record was created on 9/13 9:14 am withou=
t an email address.
This record was updated with tjones@oneok.com at 9/14 9:02 am.

The latest modification was made after we send out the notices this morning=
,  which happened
at 8:55am.  The next time that we process the emails, at the end of IDay1  =
cycle, around 1:30 pm,
these folks would receive their email notifications if this contract is cut=
 again.

Thanks,
Joe

Subject:=09Email Notifications

I made several changes to Email notifications yesterday at our shipper's re=
quest.  This morning, I received a call from the same shipper stating that =
the wrong person is still receiving the changes.  I checked the system and =
the changes ARE in PLE. =20

Specifically, I made a change to LE # 13229 Oneok Midstream (NNG Contract N=
umber 105279) listing Theresa Jones and Jimmie Mosher to receive Bumping No=
tices and Shipper Cut Notices for NNG.  Jerry Knight received the notificat=
ion this morning, Theresa and Jimmie did not. =20

The changes were made yesterday afternoon in PLE and CMS.

Does the cache need to be refreshed?  Is there a system problem?  Is there =
anything we can do to prevent this in the future?

It seems there are several occasions when I make changes in PLE that for wh=
atever reason do not make it to the downstream systems for customer notific=
ation.

Your prompt attention to this matter will be greatly appreciated.

First I want to thank you for all of your help in Kansas City, I think the training went very well.  If you have any suggestions for improvements I would really appreciate your feedback.  Secondly, If you had any comments or suggestions from the customers during the training I'm trying to get them together so I can include them with the feedback given at the other break sessions.  You can send them via e-mailing or come by my desk.

Also several of you mentioned given the new hires the training document, I think this is a great idea so I'm attaching a copy.  If after going over the document there are some questions, let me know and I will be glad to meet with them.


 

Thanks,

We do have some type of documentation regarding the storage allocations, pool allocation concerns, and on the final am cycle cuts.  I am not sure how Lynn would like to proceed with these items to our customers.

Lynn/Gerry:

Shelley requested that as part of the communication back to NNG customers, we provide and initial list of FAQ's or Q+A's.  

The following questions are ""possibles"" to answer for the FAQ area within HotTap?  


Why are there cuts on the final AM cycle that were not there for ID2?  

How does NNG allocate through the pools during a point allocation?
  
Does TMS look through the pools to the take away contract?

Storage allocations - I cannot find a specific question  

Measurement Desk - Provide contact name, phone and e-mail.


How would you like to proceed?

	Due to all the teams being on different floors, I am very concerned about coverage
	by John and Terry to accommodate all the team needs.

	Here is a plan I would like to propose for now through March, 2002.

		Terry concentrates on all TW issues and testing since he will be on 13 with the team.

		John concentrates on NNG North end and testing since he will be on 42 with the NNG team

		Mike concentrates on NNG South end and testing since he will be on 42 with the NNG team

	As each of you are on vacation, then the other 2 will cover your area.

		Another option is to have Larry and Raetta help out with the NNG teams during this time frame

	Let's discuss on Wednesday after you have had a day to think about this.

	Thanks. Lynn"

Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The information provides further details about:

	-- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge;
	-- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of     three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications;
	-- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; 
	-- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and
	-- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.

This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.  

Restatement of Earnings

Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:

Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:

	-- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997
	-- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998
	-- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 
	-- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000
	-- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 
	-- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001
	-- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  

The consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.

The restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001.

You can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/>.

We will continue to review our strategic, operational and financial position, and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments."

Okay, I've already had questions about statements in this memo.  My understanding of this is as follows:  In the event of bankruptcy, employees are guaranteed to be paid for work already completed up to an amount of $4650 (If the company were to file next week, this amount should be small since payday was today).  In addition, employees are paid for hours worked after bankruptcy at their normal salary or an amount the judge determines and such payments are not capped at $4650.

Subject:	UPDATE - Reporting to Work Next Week


Many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week, especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today.  We want to encourage you to come to work.  We continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options.  Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process.

I still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy.  But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee.  I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices.  Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority.

We are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue.  Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination.  I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you.  I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so.

While terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them.  We will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search.  We have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in Enron alumni.  We will share more information on these efforts soon.

I appreciate your continued patience and cooperation.

Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.

I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.

And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.

Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =
of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=
ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=
y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=
ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =
of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=
re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=
rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=
r imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=
ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=
tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=
vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=
stand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=
iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=
usly reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=
 areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=
nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=
ese include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=
r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=
me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering=
 these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=
.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =
of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =
concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=
mprovement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=
ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the=
 return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =
that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash=
 that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=
ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=
ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=
G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=
s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale=
 is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=
s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=
eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=
rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=
icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make=
 reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=
ecomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =
our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=
lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=
edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       ""Under Review for Further Downgrade""

-- Fitch at BBB-             ""Evolving Status""

-- S&P at BBB-              ""CreditWatch Negative""

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin=
 and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1=
0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. =
19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=
ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference =
call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next =
few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve=
stors under ""SEC Filings.""

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a =
joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint pro=
xy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes=
 available, because it will contain important information. Investors and se=
curity holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospect=
us (when it is available) and other documents containing information about =
Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Cop=

On the bottom left side of this document you will see Josh/Pager listed which you can disreguard because he is listed under Rick Dietz group.

Borderline
No.  2001-22
October 30, 2001<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"" />

 

November 1 Tariff Change

Tariff revisions detailing and addressing the use of an Operational Flow Order (OFO) on Northern Border, which were part of Northern Border's approved Park and Loan (PAL) filing, will become effective on November 1.   Here is a brief overview of the upcoming changes.

 
Purpose of an OFO
 
An OFO will be used by Northern Border to 1) alleviate conditions that threaten the integrity of the system, 2) maintain pipeline operations at pressures required to provide efficient and reliable transportation service, 3) assure adequate system line pack, and 4) maintain service for all of Northern Border's firm shippers.   
 
An OFO will be treated as a tool of last resort.  Northern Border will first attempt to utilize its system, its services (transportation and PAL), and if necessary, assistance of interconnecting systems to alleviate operational problems before invoking its OFO tariff provisions.
 
 
Posting of an OFO Watch
 
If resolution of an operational problem is unlikely, such as when a daily or cumulative OBA imbalance with an interconnected party is outside of a defined tolerance range, Northern Border will post an OFO watch.  Similar to a severe weather notice, the purpose of an OFO watch is to pre-alert shippers and interconnecting systems to a location or area on Northern Border's system in which underlying operational conditions could prompt the issuance of an OFO.
 


OFO Issuance
 
Northern Border will issue an OFO if it is determined that an OFO watch has failed to serve as a catalyst for corrective action. 
 
A Northern Border OFO will be as localized as is reasonably possible.  Furthermore, each OFO will be tailored to match the severity of the known or anticipated problem being addressed.
 
 
OFO Impact
 
An OFO can result in either the curtailment of interruptible services and/or the forced balancing of nominations and actual flows through the confirmation process.   
 
If service is reduced or interrupted due to an OFO, Northern Border will directly provide affected shippers, as soon as possible, a summary of the service interruption that will include the operational variables that prompted such action.  In addition, affected shippers will be notified of any imbalances that require immediate resolution.
 
Routine status updates will be posted throughout the period in which the OFO is in effect.
 
 
Failure to Comply
 
When an OFO is issued, it is the responsibility of the affected shippers to make a good faith effort to comply.  If such shippers fail to respond to the OFO, or their response is insufficient to correct the problem, Northern Border may take further action including the curtailment of firm service or the immediate cash out of cumulative imbalances that are in excess of 10% of the Historical Flow Quantity.
 
Northern Border will not be liable for any costs incurred by a shipper in complying with or be exposed to any damages that result from an interruption in service due to an OFO.
 
 
Impact of OFO Tariff Changes on Interconnects
 
FERC Order No. 637 requires that pipelines ""take all reasonable actions to minimize the issuance and adverse impact of Operational Flow Orders (OFOs).""  Northern Border recognizes that maintaining daily and cumulative OBA imbalances with its interconnected parties within reasonable tolerances levels is critical in meeting such obligation across the grid.  Consequently, the November 1 tariff changes includes language which define what is an acceptable tolerance range on a Northern Border OBA imbalance.
 
To serve as a benchmark, Northern Border has already begun calculating a Historical Flow Quantity (HFQ) for each point of interconnection on Northern Border's system.  The HFQ is the lesser of the average daily scheduled quantity for the previous 15 consecutive Gas Days or the actual daily flow quantity for such time period.   
 
On November 1, the default cumulative OBA imbalance tolerance level for a given interconnect on Northern Border's system will be +/- 10% of the point's HFQ.   If such approach fails to meet the needs of an interconnected party, Northern Border's tariff does permit the use of an alternative tolerance level at a given point of interconnect as long as it has been mutually agreed to both OBA parties.
 
Furthermore, the daily OBA swings at interconnects on Northern Border that are on pressure control will also be monitored more closely; the default daily OBA imbalance tolerance level will be +/- 5% of the daily scheduled quantity.  Once again, Northern Border's tariff does permit deviation from this ""standardized"" daily tolerance if an alternative method is mutually acceptable to the OBA parties. 
 
For those who would like to initiate discussions on establishing OBA imbalance tolerance levels with Northern Border that deviate from the defaults described above, please contact Scott Coburn at (402) 398.7760.

The SLA settlement is progressing more slowly than anticipated.  It now looks like we will be required to do a 4-6 month refund of Reservation & Commodity.  The latest estimate is that we wouldn't have FERC approval for revised rates pursuant to the SLA settlement until at least March.  Since the rates will be retroactive to November, 2001, we would have to refund both Res & Com for November, December, January and, at least Reservation for February.  This could become a rate-case sized refund effort.

(Linda, Ray & Wendy - While this doesn't affect you directly, it could affect your projects because of resource requirements from both IT and Gas Logistics. )

Northern is close to a Settlement with our customers involving Carlton and the SLA.

This will entail some special invoice processing.

We expect to file revised Reservation, TI Commodity and Carlton surcharge rates to be effective November 1, 2001.

However, the filing probably won't be made before November 1 and we aren't likely to have approval until the end of the year.
That means that November will be billed at the existing winter rates and 
we will need to do a 1-month refund in January to rebill November at the new rates.

We hope to have approval in time to bill both Reservation & Commodity correctly for December.  But, on the Reservation invoice, we may need to do a late ""preliminary"" run to pick up new rates, depending on when we receive an order from FERC.

As you are aware,  NNG has reached a settlement with the shippers in the SLA proceeding.  Part of the settlement provides that NNG and its shippers will work together in good faith to develop an imbalance resolution which includes a shipper option of in-kind balancing or cash out.  Also, the working group would define the parameters around which NNG could buy or sell gas into or out of the operational storage account.  Mary Kay has asked that Steve Kirk & myself co-chair this committee for NNG and that the two of you also be members of the committee on behalf of NNG.  I assume you are OK with this assignment.

We would like to get together and discuss our general approach to this effort.  Steve and I think our initial meeting could be held in the Video Conference room.    Could you let me know your availability to get together sometime next week for appr 1 -1/12 hours?

I will then try to coordinate a meeting of the group and probably include Mary Kay and possibly Dave Neubauer.

Let me know.

Thanks!

To that end, it would be helpful if Northern and the customer representatives on the team could consider holding meetings in the afternoon, after the morning trading rush.

I learned a valuable bit of information during last Friday's ""bring your kid to work day"".  My son, Daniel, and I attended an Email class and were informed of a major benefit to being on Microsoft Outlook.  To access your mail messages via your home computer or any computer that has an internet connection, you need only to type in the web address http://mail.enron.com/.  You will be prompted to enter your Enron Network Password (the one you use to initially log in with) and your inbox and mail will pull up instantly. 

You may have already known this (especially if you took the Microsoft Outlook training), but, it was new to me.  It makes it extremely easy to access our Email without having to dial or raz in through the network.  Give it a try - click on the address above!

Terry is working on the Compressor station field trip.
The teams are training as if the new hires were going to stay on their team.
South Central team has a training agenda for Cara they are going to share with TW and the North team.
Florida is waiting on May Lou to come back to have time to get Jacob to Gas Control.

Lynn, to summarize and remind us of the to do's from the luncheon.

Scott liked having a daily training agenda.
Terry and I should do the Nomination and Scheduling presentation to new hires that was done for IT.
Jacob needs to be scheduled to spend time in Gas Control
Lynn is going to contact Dan Pribble about taking new hires to a compressor station.
Teams need to be comfortable in training new hires in all aspects wheatear they know how long new hires will be on their team.

Other than that Scott and Jacob seemed satisfied with their training and progress in Customer Service.

Lynn,  I had talked to shelley right before I went on vacation about some openings you had in the scheduling area.  I don't know if she mentioned this, but christopher (my son) and a friend of his from Mount Michael are interested in applying for them.  I forwarded Pat Barry's to Shelley and Mike Barry in marketing sent Christopher's to her.  Thought I'd let you know since it appeared that shelley was on vaction and I wasn't sure when she would return.  Let me know if Mike needs to send Christopher's directly to you also.   thanks for any consideration     
How is everything else going? Oneok decision was good, except for the meter error issue.   MK

Shelley, 

Per my conversation with Mary Kay, attached is a resume for Chris Miller.  I know Chris well and believe he has the strong communication skills, intellect and drive that it takes to contribute to the ETS team.  For these reasons, I would like to recommend Chris for a position within your group. 

Please give me a call if you have any questions or would like to discuss.  Thank you for your consideration.  See you soon!

Please accept the attached Personal Achievement Award request for Harry Woodson and Tangie Dykes.  I have included both of them on the same request form since their recognition is for their contributions toward the ONEOK arbitration project.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

Lynn,

The PAA requests are being processed for Ava Garcia, Mary Draemer, and Jean McFarland.  The team may not be aware of this but PAA payments are reserved for employees so the request form for Glenn Stovall will not be valid since he is a contractor.  Please call us if you have any questions.

Thanks and have a great day,

About the PAAs-

You may fill out one PAA form for all the folks that have the same justification.  In the name section type ""Various - see attached list"".  Then,  fill out the details on each person with a supplemental sheet.  Provided is a template.  

When complete, submit to Tracy Scott.  Hopefully, this will save some time.

Dear Amber, Alfredo and Fabio,
many thanks for the opportunity of visiting Enron in Houston.
Your colleagues provided me with a great lot of information and advice.
Rebecca Cantrell and Lynn Blair were very kind and helpful, in sparing their time with me and in organizing other meetings with colleagues.
They are very fine and I appreciate.
Maybe we would discuss, should the occasion come, some of the aspects of open access in the USA and their appropriateness for the italian case.
Best Regards
Mauro Formaggio"

The year-end performance evaluation process is a great opportunity for employees and their supervisors to review accomplishments for the year and identify opportunities for personal growth.  Additionally, it is an opportunity for each of us to provide meaningful performance feedback to help others.  This memo is intended to summarize the major elements of this important process and clarify the timeline for year-end 2001.

(Note: ETS employees on self-directed work teams that participate in the Skill-based Pay program will complete team and peer performance reviews as they have in the past and are exempted from the discussion that follows.)

Feedback and Evaluation
Employees will solicit 360? feedback on their performance via the PEP system. The supervisor will use this feedback, along with other performance data about the employee, to prepare a written evaluation of the employee's performance for the year.  The employee and supervisor will then meet and discuss this evaluation which provides an objective measure of the employee's performance against expectations.  The performance evaluation is an opportunity to discuss accomplishments, areas for improvement and goals for the next year.  No overall performance rating will be designated.

?	PEP System open for feedback			November 19 - December 7
?	Performance discussions with supervisor	December 10 - January 14
?	Written evaluations due to HR			January 15

Training for all employees on how to use the PEP system will be available via online tutorials.

Compensation
Increases in an employee's base pay for merit, promotion or equity can be recommended by an individual supervisor based on the employee's performance, current responsibilities and salary.  Division Head approval is required.

As always, incentive awards are paid at the discretion of the Enron Board Compensation Committee and the Enron Office of the Chairman based on company and business unit performance. Once bonus pools are approved, individual bonuses will be determined by division and department heads based on employee performance.

Relative Talent Reviews
Relative talent reviews will occur beginning January 16, 2002 and will include discussions of Managers and above.  The focus is not on relative ranking but on identifying employees who best demonstrate the performance, skills and behaviors that are valued at Enron.  Each Division will identify its top 10% and discuss the utilization of its top talent.  Employees who may be ready to assume greater responsibilities will be discussed.  Recommendations for promotions will be considered up through Senior Director.  EGS executive management will review Vice Presidents and Managing Directors and identify the top 10% in this officer group.  Nomination for promotions to Vice President and Managing Director levels will be made to the Enron Management Committee, which will make final decisions on these promotions.

If you have any questions about any aspect of this year-end process, I encourage you to contact your HR representative.

Gary

There is new information in our TEAM PROCEDURE BOOK ( The White Binder that has our lovely team picture on it) This information includes plant procedures for locations that NNG does not have set control on. This is a guideline that the after hours / weekend rep can use as a reference when gas controls calls with a problem. The phone numbers and contacts are up to date,  however some of the plant names should be updated. I'll work on that part next. Joe and I will also put this information in a common folder so the team can update and can keep things current. This will be in the book tabbed ""PLANT PROCEDURES"" . remember these are locations NNG has no set control.

thanks,

Jerry, I want to take this opportunity and thank you for the high level of customer service you provided to Alliant-WP&L today.  I received an email from Kelly Schneider this morning letting me know how much they appreciated your help.  By alerting them that their final cycle noms were off by one MMBtu, they were able to fix their noms to prevent the whole batch being invalidated.

Thank you again!

With the event of having to put a reason in TMS for timeline extensions and all reliability calls going to the HotTap Help Desk and being logged into Remedy, Customer Service Representatives will no longer be required to fill out the Waiver Log. Yes it is true, we can report on the timeline extensions from TMS,  Remedy will be used for the Reliability reporting so we can do away with another manual process.  

Please make sure all reliability calls go through the HotTap Help Desk so they may be logged into Remedy by the Help Desk and used for reliability reporting!

Put as informative of statement in TMS as you can for timeline extensions, some have been a little brief. In your statement let us know if the timeline is extended due to TMS system problems, waiting for El Paso confirmations, Customers are experiencing problems in their system, Contracts group requested an extension for a new contract and so on. This will be our official documentation for timeline waivers in case of an audit.  
 If you need more examples please let me know and I will provide them to you. 

If you have any questions please give me a call 37429

Reyna and I have reviewed and discussed your question and provide the following as guidelines for allocating storage:

Allocate storage during the Timely, Evening, Non-Grid, and IntraDay 1 cycles whenever net scheduled storage activity exceeds the operational capacity by more than 500 MMBtu.
Allocate storage during the IntraDay 2 Cycle if a storage allocation was performed during any of that gas day's earlier cycles (using the 500 MMBtu Rule) or when there were no previous storage allocations were performed during the gas day but the net scheduled storage activity for the IntraDay 2 cycle exceeds operational capacity by more than 5,000 MMBtu. 

If you have any additional questions, please advise.

Customer Service Reps. have requested from the Storage Group some allocation guidelines to follow as to when to call Storage on whether or not to allocate storage. For example if only 4,000 DTH needs allocated do we allocate or do we call to see if storage wants to lift the allocation. Can you provide us with some guidelines to follow even if it for us to allocate no mater how much is over capacity, that information would eliminate some concerns the Customer Service Reps. have.

I wanted to let you know how thankful I am for the help I received from the TW scheduling group over the past couple of months as I've worked--and struggled--on the TW Daily Balancing Report. I have made repeated phone calls to Houston and have always received prompt and courteous attention from the group as I've tried to understand TMS and TW's systems and scheduling peculiarities. I have worked with Amy Mulligan, Cynthia Rivers, Linda Ward, Christine McEvoy and Bert Hernandez.

In particular, I felt impelled to let you know that Bert Hernandez has been especially helpful in my endeavours. Bert and I spent many hours on the phone discussing TW's scheduling intricacies. He has been very patient with me and always made himself available to me to answer my questions. He was able to discuss in great detail many TW transactions, including why and how transactions appear the way they do, and what the transactional data means. He even went so far as to ask other departments for explanations as questions arose, rather than referring me to someone else, and never failed to follow-up on a question I had.

In short, I could not have made the progress I have without Bert's help.

The report is still being finalized, but Marketing and Gas Control have already employed the report with great success in managing Transwestern pipeline activities. Incremental gas sales deals were done in June and July utilizing information from the report, and the Commercial Support and Financial Accounting groups are looking at the report for ways to employ it in their work.

Again, I just wanted to pass along to you that your team was instrumental in the development of the report, and I wanted to give them the appropriate recognition. I thought I'd better send this now as opposed to waiting for PEP, lest I forget. I also believe that good news shouldn't wait. We don't always hear enough of it!

Thanks again!

This is the schedule so far for Mr. Formaggio, who has asked to meet with someone in Enron to understand more about the general operation of a big pipeline (dispatching, the nomination and balancing operation, the allocation of measurement, and other major aspects of third-party-access implementation, including OBAs with interconnecting pipelines).

He was scheduled to arrive this afternoon, and will be staying at the Hyatt Regency.  

Thursday, 8/23

9:00 through	Arrive at Enron.  He was given either Ginger Dernehl or myself as initial contacts.  
   Lunch	Advise John Buchanan of arrival (X.37429).  
	John will come to 47 to escort Mauro down to 41 for presentations by Lynn Blair and others about ETS gas logistics.
	Then Mauro will meet with Dannis Bellard for a tour of Gas Control.

3:30-4:30	Meet with Julie Gomez, VP of Long-Term Fundamentals-Gas


Friday, 8/24

11:00-12:00	Meet with Rick Shapiro and Jim Steffes, Government Affairs-The Americas

I am trying to arrange a meeting also with George Smith, either at about 2:00 on Thursday or on Friday morning.  He is a manager in the EWS logistics area who could talk about pipeline operation from the shipper perspective."

Joe is on vacation all week.

Lynn is planning to go over scheduling/transportation business - we can stretch this out into a couple of hours.  We are also planning a gas control tour with Danny Bellard -- probably another  hour.  

Nobody has ever given us precise times for this visit.  Who is the host for this visit?

Guys, I'm a little - no, a lot -- concerned about this guy who's coming in Thursday.  He's expecting to learn about the general operation of a big pipeline.  I haven't set anything up for him with anyone from ENA because I can't see a fit with what he wants to see.  I don't know why Jim would have given them my name.

John Buchanan told me that his presentation was going to take no more than a hour and a half.   He didn't know if Lynn Blair had anything else scheduled.  Please tell me y'all have some other contacts arranged!!

Alfredo --

I would think that it would be best to talk with (1) Joe Hartsoe in our DC office (Enron's P/L chief FERC regulatory guy) and either Becky Cantrell or Leslie Lawner from a shipper's perspective.  

Joe is in Houston every once in a while.  You may want to contact him directly.  Becky works from Houston.  Leslie has to come in from New Mexico.

Rick, as I mentioned to you last week, I would like you to help to organise the visit of two italian officials this summer. The first one is

- Mauro Formaggio (Director of Gas at the Italian Gas and Power Regulatory Authority)

I have a very good relationship with him and we have helped him in the past re. UK Gas Grid Code and other issues regarding gas TPA. He is now working on the TPA rules applicable to the Italian gas market, and he is asking if he could meet someone in Enron to understand more about the general operation of a big pipeline (despatching operation, commercial scheduling of transmission, nomination, balancing and allocation, as well as to the infomation that the pipeline gives to the general public and to regulatory authorities). Please, see this e-mail below. He has not yet decided the dates, but he is aiming at last week of August, for 1/2 days. 

I would suggest you could put me in touch with someone in our organisation who could help on this, and I would co-ordinate Formaggio's meeting.


Alfredo,
I'm scheduling a visit to the USA on the practice of TPA. in the month
of August.
The aspects I'm considering are:
- how OBAs are organized and how they are applied,
- the operation of hubs,
- the balancing penalties,
- the trading of capacity
- the general operation of a (big) pipeline
- the general operation of a state pipeline, and of a LDC
- the operation of a shipper
Please let me know whether you deem it feasible also a meeting with your
american colleagues on any of these items.
---
In the meantime I have arranged for a visit to a major shipper and trader, in Atlanta (on the access as it is seen and done by a shipper, on many pipelines and storages), and to another major shipper and producer in Houston (on the relationship with FERC and other regulatory authorities, as well as on the access practice).
A visit to a major pipeline would fit well in this framework. To my opinion, Northern would be all right. It should act as a model to what could also be arranged, with time, by big transmission operator(s) in our country. It could refer to the dispatching operation, and to the commercial scheduling of transmission, to the nomination, balancing and allocation, as well as to the infomation that the pipeline gives to the general public and to regulatory authorities. If possible, two days would be a proper duration.
I think you can consider me a relatively well informed person, so there would be no need of formal presentations. The opportunity to see real operations and to discuss with experts would be all right. 
In the past, when I was in Snam, I took the opportunity of keeping in touch with the developments in the Usa. So, I already have a relatively good general knowledge of the american system. Last time was some years ago, when I visited Transcanada, in Calgary, for a week (focusing on nomination and balancing). Among the pipelines I visited in the course of earlier years, there were EL Paso, PG&E, Northwestern and also Northern for a short visit.
Going to Omaha would not be a problem for me.
As for the period, it would be in the second half of August (because with september there would be a very heavy workload to do, here in Milano).
Thank you and best regards
Mauro


Dear Alfredo,
I'm finalizig this week the program for a visit in the USA for and updte
on TPA practice, there.
Among of meetings I'm going to arrange, it would be of interest a visit
at a major pipeline.
Northern seems to me a good example. Would you envisage it as a possible
example for me?
I would discuss the organization of dispatching, see the nomination and
balancing operation, the allocation of measurement, and other major
aspects of TPA implementation (including OBAs with interconnecting
pipelines) for transmission and storage.
I'm considering the end of August for such a visit. Owing to the extent
of the subjects, maybe two days would be appropriate.
Thank you and best regards
Mauro

    Ava, please add Jean Blair to the shift differential for Nov. 1.  It is important that jean is
    working the whole month either 10:00 to 7:00 or Shirley's shift to get the differential.
    Therefore I would not envision Jean being the 6:30 a.m. or 8:30 a.m. person.
    Thanks. Lynn

Lynn,
    After further discussion, Jean Blair has volunteered to be the primary back up for Shirley and second evening person.  This will change her shift hours from 10-7 to cover the core evening hours, provide additional support for Shirley, and be able to fill in for Shirley while she is on comp days or vacation.  Will this be acceptable in order for Jean to receive the differential pay for working an evening shift?  Thanks.

    The team has decided that we only need one primary evening person, which is Shirley Walden.  In the event that Shirley is out of the office, the team will use a rotational schedule between all team members to cover the evening shift.  I have attached a tentative schedule for evening coverage. If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks.

     solved. I just sent a memo to Glenn Stovall telling him that I will be out of the office on vacation until July 23, but to please
     keep at it. I've already had the phone company and Roadrunner to my house for the installations. Alma has provided me
     with a cell phone. The team has been discussing all the issues involved regarding communication, etc. when I am working
     from home. With the delays, it looks like the parallel with a backup in the office won't start until August. Thus, Nancy will
     be my backup for the parallel since she is the August backup. Jean will be covering my vacation as the July backup. My
     childcare arrangements will not change when I start working from home. Zach will continue his afternoon childcare routine
     and my husband, Steve, cares for him in the evening. My home office is upstairs in an unused bedroom. I've got two desks
     to cover my work computer and the home computer we already had. I'm concerned about the chair situation. My office chair
     doesn't offer the back support needed for full-time use that my Enron chair provides. Can I use my Enron chair at home? I
     will come in once a week on Tuesday afternoons for meetings and interface with my team. My team is supportive of me in         
     this opportunity and I am committed to providing excellent night owl coverage.  "

	Attached is the ""Quick Tip"" document that I have prepared to help us with the customer training.  Please review the document and I will set up a meeting next week to go over any questions or concerns.  Attached is the list of the customers that will be attending the training, let me know if there is specific customer or customers that you would rather visit with.

I'm going through some final reviews.  However, since my morning is booked, I'm going to send the presentation now.  There might be minor changes but probably not significant.

I have two questions about the Service Requester Scheduled Quantity report
that came on line this week:

1.  Does it have to be legal size?  The previous report was very readable
and it was 8 1/2 x 11, landscape

2.  This report gives no month-to-date totals and now I have to get two
reports on each pipeline every day in order to reconcile our system
correctly.  Is there any way the first page of the old report could be added
to this report so that month-to-date totals can be seen? "

Cinergy's Paulette, who handles NNG, and Belinda, who handles TWPL, have just telephoned to ask what happened to these reports -- they use them to monitor month to date totals, distributions, and third party package information.  They are begging for the reports to return.

Brooks uses these for documentation as well for all of their agencies.  (TransCanada).

John/Terry/Raetta/Larry,

OGE and Aquila use the month to date volumes on the schedule volume reports. I also use them to send to Mark Walden for the NNG Admin. contract every month. If the report needs to be different for some reason can the old one be put back in place for those of us that use it regularly? I hope consideration is given to reinstating the former contents of this report. It sounds like there are several people (both external and internal) who would like to be able to access the data that used to appear on the scheduled quantities reports. 

Just giving some extra feedback on the subject!

John, Please don't kill the messenger, but Lamar Power called along with CMS Marketing today asking that the Scheduled Quantities Report please be reinstated.  This report included receipt and delivery volumes, a summary, as well as, Month to date information. The new report gives them very little to work with and a lot of information they don't need on this report.

Subject:	Storage Allocations 

Gerry, 
This past weekend, specfically September 3rd,  storage injections during the ID2 process were allocated by approximately 130,000 MMBtu. The net storage injections at the end of the allocation was approximately 600,000 MMBtu. However, during the confirmation process certain deliveries, sourced with PNR withdrawals, were not confirmed by the downstream parties. The confirmation process resulted in cuts to PNR withdrawals that allowed net storage injections to be scheduled in excess of the 600,000 MMBtu capacity. The pipeline was able to absorb the extra gas this weekend but in the future NNG may not be as fortunate. 

Is there some way for the system to send out a notice whenever, after all the dust settles and the entire cycle is completed, the net scheduled storage activity exceeds storage capacity by a significant quantity? 

When you get a minute ...lets discuss.   "

Subject:	Northern v. ONEOK/Fisher Roc Outage Letter


	Drew,

	Grant is putting the finishing touches on the proposed letter to ONEOK explaining the Fisher Roc lock up period of September 12-16 and what we will do to resolve it.  Long and short, we are declaring that this is an ""error in the Inlet/Outlet meter formula"", rather than a ""Btu measurement error,"" because there was nothing wrong with Northern's chromatograph that caused this problem.  Accordingly, we will not be using the Plant's PTR during the outage period, but rather a formula based on the ratio between the rich inlet and rich outlet volumes for a period of time before and after the outage period, as per 2b.(iv) of the Measurement Agreement.

	I will circulate a draft of the letter to all by e-mail once I get it from Grant.  It is prepared for signature by Ken Cessac.

	Questions:
	
	1.  Who with ETS needs to be on the copy list on this and any future letters regarding measurement errors at Bushton?

	2.  Who at ONEOK (maybe more than one person?) should receive this letter?

	Many thanks for your input.

	Britt

1.	Mandatory cash-out each month (after netting and option to trade).
2.	Definition of 6 indices (vs. 3 in current tariff).
3.	Parties may mutually agree to cash out PNR.  Could probably do today without this language.
4.	Clarification that PNR may be used by Operators.
5.	May use PNR for ""auto-balancing"".

Proposed in TW's 637 Filing - Could ""Trade""

1.	Daily balancing.  Including daily tolerance, daily auto-transfer to PNR & daily pricing.
2.	Smaller tolerance range.  Proposed change from +/- 10% to +/- 5%.

Subject: Northern v. ONEOK/Proposed Letter to ONEOK re Fisher Roc


Everyone:
 
Here's the proposed letter to ONEOK regarding the Fisher Roc lock-up period of September 12-16.  I need and would greatly appreciate your immediate input as follows:
 
1.  Please provide any and all substantive and stylistic comments ASAP.  We have absolutely got to have the facts straight, so please don't assume that anyone will catch something that you see that is in error; let me know.  I would like to get this out this afternoon, as Gary Anderson's folks are already inputting the adjusted volumes/Btus that Ken Cessac formulated into the system, and ONEOK will receive that information shortly.  Again, kudos to Ken for his usual excellent job on this.
 
2.  We are missing an ""an"" in the first sentence, right before the word ""incident""; that will be corrected.
 
3.  The letter has been set up for Ken Cessac's signature, but let us know if it should come from someone else.
 
4.  I have the spreadsheet that Ken will attach to the letter.  Using our numbers, the variance is a bit larger during the Fisher Roc outage period, than before or after, based on the Plant PTR numbers we have already been provided for that period (although we don't know if those numbers are final).  Before the outage period, for the month of September (so, September 1-part of  September 12), the average variance was about .5%.  During the outage period, before Ken's adjustment of our numbers (so, part of September 12 through part of September 16), the average variance was 8.2%.  Still staying within the outage period, after Ken's adjustment of our numbers (per the spreadsheet that will be attached to his letter), the average variance is 2.8%.  Since the Fisher Roc was fixed on September 16, we have no Plant PTR numbers, so we can't tell what the variance is yet.  I will separately e-mail a copy of the spreadsheet.
 
5.  Who at ONEOK should receive this letter?  Ken mentioned a new plant accounting-type named Jeff Knight who has provided him with figures.  We could always cc to other ONEOK representatives.  Maybe Kim Hardeman?
 
 6.  As Grant suggested yesterday, and I agree, this letter will not prompt any agreement by ONEOK; in fact, we expect ONEOK to come back with a protest and a demand that we use PTR for this period.  We'll keep you advised.
 
Many thanks.
 
Britt

Lynn, I need to take a 1/2 a day vacation on Monday, September 24th to leave at noon and I would come in early that day too and 1/2 a day vacation on Tuesday, September 25th I would be in the office at noon time.  I would like to go to a cousins wedding out of town and I've put it off because of the move but am being harassed by family but if it's not possible that's okay.

Thanks,

Subject:	ETS' TW Teams Appreciation Luncheon - Last Round


Because a large number of our invitees had conflicting schedules, we are moving the date of our Appreciation Luncheon for the LAST TIME!!! 

This will be our last attempt to accommodate everyone.  Trust me, the food and games at Jillians will be well worth your patience.

Steve's main objective was to include as many of  ETS' TW Teams as possible.  We feel that Friday,  the 5th of October would better suit the majority of our teams.  

We thank you for your patience and please respond by September 26.

Again, I'd like to get out the letter from Ken, with this spreadsheet attached, this afternoon.

Many thanks.

     Britt, to answer #5, Kim Hardman and/or Delaine Kurth may be added to the cc on the letter.  The reason I mention Delaine
    is Jerry Knight (who works for Delaine) is the person that has been calling Robert Benningfield asking for the
    status of the 12 - 16 adjustment.  Thanks. Lynn

Good letter.  One suggestion--our insistence that the meters and the chromatograph ""were reliably and accurately . . ."" doing their respective things sounds kind of defensive.  In fact, we don't know what they were doing because we have no record of the data they sent to the ROC, right?  Would it be less adversarial to simply say ""the ultrasonic meters . . .continued to operate normally. . ."" and to say the same for the chromatograph?  We do know that the meters and chromatograph did continue to operate because they had not shut down, right?  Also, I'd like to better understand the formula we're using to alibi the data.  What are ""the time periods of normal operation""?  Was that ratio developed from our data from Sep. 1-12?  IF so, why does the formula create such a significant increase in the variance?  Thanks. df

	Ranelle, John and Michelle,  thought I would send this statement to you and see if this
	helps simplify our answer to your question.  

	The question is:  How is MDQ used in the nomination system to ensure we do not
	double up on MDQ volumes when we have split paths (i.e. nom on same contract
	from (1) Mid 15 to Bushton Inlet and from (2) Bushton Outlet to Demac)

	For Nominating purposes:

	MDQ of contract = Primary Firm + Alternate Firm up to the MDQ. 
	Anything over the MDQ will be Overrun and charged at the IT rate.

Please be informed, because a large number of our invitees had conflicting schedules, we are moving the date of our Appreciation Luncheon.  Steve's main objective was to include as many of  ETS' TW Teams as possible.  To achieve this effort, the luncheon will be moved to a date and time which does not conflict with activities within ETS.  

As soon as we confirm our date, we will notify you via email.

Thanks in advance for your patience and understanding.

	Is the volume at the inlet and outlet of Bushton factored into any MDQ total?  Gerry
	if you are not the person to help us on this, please let me know who.  Also in talking
	with Mary Darveaux she said if you use the same contract at the inlet and outlet of
	Bushton, you DO double your MDQ.  Therefore, if you have 10,000 MDQ you can 
	only nominate 5,000 to inlet and 5,000 at outlet.  

	Gerry, can we run a quick report to see if there are any contracts that are identical
	on the inlet and outlet of Bushton?   If she is right, then we have NOT had anyone
	nominate on the same contract.  If I have confused you, let's discuss.  Thanks. Lynn

Subject:	RE: Questions on MDQ 

So when a shipper is required (because of the producer's processing rights) to nominate from their primary receipt point to Bushton Inlet and then from the Bushton Outlet to Demarc, is that treated as one nomination from a receipt to a delivery OR is that treated as two nominations on the same contract with one receipt at their primary receipt point and another receipt at the Bushton Outlet thus exceeding the contract MDQ sending the shipper into overrun (assuming the shipper was nominating the entire MDQ throughout the path)?

Didn't we also have a situation where shippers were going from a receipt point to Demarc and not going through Bushton when they were supposed to--or maybe it was that shippers were going from Bushton Outlet to Demarc and not getting charged fuel when they weren't supposed to be able to do that transaction--I just remember something happening not too long ago.

Thanks for the help with these questions.

	Ranelle, John and Michelle,  thought I would send this statement to you and see if this

	The question is:  How is MDQ used in the nomination system to ensure we do not
	double up on MDQ volumes when we have split paths (i.e. nom on same contract
	from (1) Mid 15 to Bushton Inlet and from (2) Bushton Outlet to Demac)

	For Nominating purposes:

	MDQ of contract = Primary Firm + Alternate Firm up to the MDQ. 
	Anything over the MDQ will be Overrun and charged at the IT rate.

	Point MDQ needs to be considered when allocating a receipt point.

	EXAMPLE:

	If the Field MDQ is 10,000, then we will  (1) total the reciepts nominated on the
	contract; (2) compare the total nominated to the Contract MDQ.  Then the shipper

FYI - In working to load rates for the FERC California reporting requirements, it appears that for the last four months Duke Energy T & M contract #27291 has not been billed the incremental fee of $0.06/dth for alternate deliveries to the Cal Border (over and above the base discount negotiated for the contracted primary points).

Importance:	High

Gerry/Lynn:

Yes, the volume nominated to the inlet/from the outlet is factored into a firm contracts MDQ total.   

At a high-level,  there should be no special MDQ-related coding at Bushton inlet/outlet that causes an override (per se) of a contract's MDQ allowing shippers to ""double"" their contract MDQ. 

I did a preliminary check (using model office) to confirm coding logic at the nomination level......looking at K#6425 (BP Energy) that has a total contract MDQ of 20,835 MMbtu.   When nominating above the 20,835 K# MDQ; you can only nominate to inlet/from outlet up to the contract's MDQ utilizing transaction type 01 (current business).  Any additional vols. nominated above the contract MDQ must then be nominated as transaction type 02 (overrun).  

We do have shippers that nom in to & out of the plant on the same contract... .....initial research indicated there are contracts that are identical on the inlet and outlet of Bushton; i.e., same contract nominating to inlet is the same contract picking up the gas at the outlet.    The IT Group ; however, could run a quick report to check/confirm this.  

Hope I answered your questions......  

Legale

	Shelley, things were quite on NNG and TW overall for the weekend.

	For all three pipes the reps had to go through RAZ to get into TMS on Saturday morning.
	Although, the customers were able to get in OK, but the system was slow.  System was fixed by 11:30 a.m. 
	Saturday morning.

	On TW - For Gallop Darrell has sent you an update.

	Overall for TW the prices for the east are not covering variables to go west, therefore
	most of the gas is staying in the east market.

	Thanks. Lynn

Attached please find a draft letter to Hibbing explaining to them why Northern has the right to limit takes at a TBS and why Northern will require them to pay for the TBS upgrade so that they can take more.  Bob would like to send this out on Monday, so can I please have your comments as soon as possible on Monday.  Thanks, Dari

Subject:	RE: Questions on MDQ 
Importance:	High

Gerry/Lynn:

Yes, the volume nominated to the inlet/from the outlet is factored into a firm contracts MDQ total.   

At a high-level,  there should be no special MDQ-related coding at Bushton inlet/outlet that causes an override (per se) of a contract's MDQ allowing shippers to ""double"" their contract MDQ. 

I did a preliminary check (using model office) to confirm coding logic at the nomination level......looking at K#6425 (BP Energy) that has a total contract MDQ of 20,835 MMbtu.   When nominating above the 20,835 K# MDQ; you can only nominate to inlet/from outlet up to the contract's MDQ utilizing transaction type 01 (current business).  Any additional vols. nominated above the contract MDQ must then be nominated as transaction type 02 (overrun).  

We do have shippers that nom in to & out of the plant on the same contract... .....initial research indicated there are contracts that are identical on the inlet and outlet of Bushton; i.e., same contract nominating to inlet is the same contract picking up the gas at the outlet.    The IT Group ; however, could run a quick report to check/confirm this.  

Hope I answered your questions......

	Is the volume at the inlet and outlet of Bushton factored into any MDQ total?  Gerry
	if you are not the person to help us on this, please let me know who.  Also in talking
	with Mary Darveaux she said if you use the same contract at the inlet and outlet of
	Bushton, you DO double your MDQ.  Therefore, if you have 10,000 MDQ you can 
	only nominate 5,000 to inlet and 5,000 at outlet.  

	Gerry, can we run a quick report to see if there are any contracts that are identical
	on the inlet and outlet of Bushton?   If she is right, then we have NOT had anyone
	nominate on the same contract.  If I have confused you, let's discuss.  Thanks. Lynn

Subject:	RE: Questions on MDQ 

So when a shipper is required (because of the producer's processing rights) to nominate from their primary receipt point to Bushton Inlet and then from the Bushton Outlet to Demarc, is that treated as one nomination from a receipt to a delivery OR is that treated as two nominations on the same contract with one receipt at their primary receipt point and another receipt at the Bushton Outlet thus exceeding the contract MDQ sending the shipper into overrun (assuming the shipper was nominating the entire MDQ throughout the path)?

Didn't we also have a situation where shippers were going from a receipt point to Demarc and not going through Bushton when they were supposed to--or maybe it was that shippers were going from Bushton Outlet to Demarc and not getting charged fuel when they weren't supposed to be able to do that transaction--I just remember something happening not too long ago.

Thanks for the help with these questions.

Subject:	Questions on MDQ 

	Ranelle, John and Michelle,  thought I would send this statement to you and see if this
	helps simplify our answer to your question.  

	The question is:  How is MDQ used in the nomination system to ensure we do not
	double up on MDQ volumes when we have split paths (i.e. nom on same contract
	from (1) Mid 15 to Bushton Inlet and from (2) Bushton Outlet to Demac)

	For Nominating purposes:

	MDQ of contract = Primary Firm + Alternate Firm up to the MDQ. 
	Anything over the MDQ will be Overrun and charged at the IT rate.

	Point MDQ needs to be considered when allocating a receipt point.

	EXAMPLE:

	If the Field MDQ is 10,000, then we will  (1) total the reciepts nominated on the
	contract; (2) compare the total nominated to the Contract MDQ.  Then the shipper
	will get firm (primary and alternate) up to their contract MDQ.  Anything over will be 
	overrun at IT rate.

	If anyone has any other questions, please let me know.  Thanks. Lynn

	Team, I realize this rate change is done in Marketing.  But, you have a responsibility
	to review the invoice to ensure that the adjustment to the price has been made if
	there is alternate deliveries.  Let's be proactive to ensure we have accurate billing.
	If you have any questions, please let me know.

This adjustment will result in approximately $7800 in additional revenues.  

One way to prevent this situation in the future would be for the rep and or myself to ensure that Duke's rate has been increased when they have alternate deliveries to the border.   If these alternate deliveries exist and the rate has not been increased then the rep needs to bring this situation to the attention of the marketer.

FYI - In working to load rates for the FERC California reporting requirements, it appears that for the last four months Duke Energy T & M contract #27291 has not been billed the incremental fee of $0.06/dth for alternate deliveries to the Cal Border (over and above the base discount negotiated for the contracted primary points).

I want to clarify the problem. In researching the problem I found that the rate retrieved for PnR was slightly higher than the rate retrieved for FDD Overrun. In our discussions with Bill Anderson, we focused  on how this impacted the contract he asked us to review. Bottom line is in storage allocations, the LSP -Whitewater overrun activity should have received a greater portion of the available injection capacity.
The IT group is correcting the problem. The 7.61 cent PnR rate will be hard coded in the allocation program this afternoon as interim fix until the proper system modifications are ready.

Subject:	US Energy/LS Power storage allocation issue
Importance:	High

Hello,

Mike Bodnar and I called Bill Anderson at US Energy today regarding his complaints about the storage allocation process.  Bill has claimed that LS Power is being allocated down to zero on days when he should be receiving a pro-rata share of the overrun injections on any given day throughout the summer.  

Mike found out that LS Power - Whitewater was being incorrectly allocated down to zero on certain days throughout the summer due to the system pointing to an incorrect (discounted) overrun rate for the storage account of LS Power - Whitewater.  LS Power was being charged the full, non-discounted overrun rate on their FDD contract.  

US Energy will undoubtedly want to negotiate a settlement of some sort, since they believe this has been an issue since 6/1/01.   

I believe we need to do the following:

1 - Determine if the other LS Power plant (Cottage Grove) was also affected by this system error.
2 - Determine the date that the incorrect rate took affect.
3 - Determine how LS Power overrun injections throughout this summer were affected by this, since 6/1/01.
4 - Determine a fair and equitable solution to this issue (as of 6/1/01) to present to the customer within three weeks.

I will set up a video meeting as soon as possible with regards to this issue.

	Tim, I would like for us to discuss this issue. Normally we do not ""settle"" on these
	type of issues.  I want to be consistent with how we have treated other shippers when
	we have found errors in the system.  Doesn't mean we can't do a settlement,  we just
	don't want it to back fire on us. 

	Ava, please set up some time on Thursday for Tim, Mike, Bob, Sue and I to visit.

	Thanks. Lynn

Hey Lynn!  Lunch sounds great.  However, I'm off tomorrow - I'm going on a little retreat with my mom.  And then on Thursday, I'm having lunch with my new boss!  Maybe we could grab a coffee on Thursday afternoon.  I'll call you.  I hope you're not feeling the pain!

Shelley/Lynn

As you know, we are getting fairly close to an understanding with Williams regarding NNG's MOPS assets.  As we continue to negotiate the PSA, one item has come up that we need your help with.  Williams has requested that we enter into an Operating Agreement with them to assure a continuity of service for the MOPS shippers.  They are concerned that the period of time from closing to them being able to incorporating the administrative functions into their back office systems may be disruptive.  They would like for us to continue to schedule the pipe, take the nominations, post information on the Bulletin Board, even submit invoices to the shippers, confirm with upstream and downstream parties, etc.... while they adapt their systems to these new assets.

I am assuming that once we close, we can no longer do these functions as NNG, but  would be acting as their agent.  It is still unclear which Williams entity will be acquiring the assets, so we still don't know which Tariff we would be working with. Can our systems segregate this administrative function from the rest of NNG to allow us to perform for a third party?  I don't anticipate more than a six month period of us performing these duties.  We will also need to develop a fee structure to assure all or expenses are recouped, and then add a reasonable surcharge (maybe 15%?).

They will also require Operational support, but the current contract between NNG and Enron Operations will be assigned to them.  

Thanks for your help.

Lynn,
All of our agent roles in the past have been to act as agent on NNG or TW for a customer not take nominations or do accounting as a third party pipe. TMS could probably be split out to take care of the nominations and confirmations but who's Tariff rules would it follow? if theirs TMS would have to be programmed for them, we would also need to duplicate a web site for postings. Confirmations up and down stream would not be much of a problem. Do you want IT to work up an estimate for the work and a timeline? I will talk to Donna about the fee associated with this role; she handled the Calpine agreement for TW which was different from the Northwest agreement. 
Let me know if you want me to procede.

Subject:	MOPS Operating Contract

Shelley/Lynn

As you know, we are getting fairly close to an understanding with Williams regarding NNG's MOPS assets.  As we continue to negotiate the PSA, one item has come up that we need your help with.  Williams has requested that we enter into an Operating Agreement with them to assure a continuity of service for the MOPS shippers.  They are concerned that the period of time from closing to them being able to incorporating the administrative functions into their back office systems may be disruptive.  They would like for us to continue to schedule the pipe, take the nominations, post information on the Bulletin Board, even submit invoices to the shippers, confirm with upstream and downstream parties, etc.... while they adapt their systems to these new assets.

I am assuming that once we close, we can no longer do these functions as NNG, but  would be acting as their agent.  It is still unclear which Williams entity will be acquiring the assets, so we still don't know which Tariff we would be working with. Can our systems segregate this administrative function from the rest of NNG to allow us to perform for a third party?  I don't anticipate more than a six month period of us performing these duties.  We will also need to develop a fee structure to assure all or expenses are recouped, and then add a reasonable surcharge (maybe 15%?).

They will also require Operational support, but the current contract between NNG and Enron Operations will be assigned to them.  

Thanks for your help.

Subject:	Small Volume Delivery Points in the Field

I would like at host a meeting to discuss new small volume delivery points in the field.  The Business Development group has at least three requests from different entities for new delivery points.  The issues to be discussed at the meeting include type of measurement to be installed at the point, applicability of DDVCs. balancing, OBAs and a host of other issues.  These small volume points take an extraordinary amount of time for many departments and produce a very small amount of revenue for ETS.  Anything that can be done to simplify the process would be a cost benefit to ETS.  

The meeting details are as follows:


	Day			Wednesday
	Date			October 10, 2001
	Time 			3:00 P.M.
	Location		Houston EB 42C2   (relocation of the video conference facilities)
				Omaha 696


I look forward to receiving your input at the meeting.  Please free to forward this meeting notice to anyone you think would like to be involved in this process that I have missed.  Thanks

Subject:	Final Review of FERC California Reporting - August 2001
Importance:	High

Please review the spreadsheets attached.  These are my notes associated with any outstanding items requiring final review/approval:

Item 1 - I have received the remainder of outstanding rates from TK and populated into the PDT records.  TK/Lindy, please provide email if corrections are necessary.
Item 3 - After discussions with Lynn, we chose to round up Daily Max Flowing Capacity for gas days 8/1 and 8/3 (both from 1,092,956 to 1,093,000) so this would not raise questions or require footnote explanations.  I have also updated the footnotes and comments provided by Terry/Darrell/Lynn and populated accordingly into PDS and PFS.
Item 4 - I compared the daily scheduled volumes by California delivery point provided under RP00-241-000 (CPUC vs El Paso) SCE-7 against the volumes extracted from TMS and highlighted the nine records having discrepancies, where the data to the right of the matrix is the amount reported in the prior request.  I would recommend that we adjust to the previously reported volumes.  I was not able to extract the website operational capacity volumes for each point in the West of Thoreau area; however, I did verify that the monthly Total Scheduled System Volume (PDSM) less the monthly Total Scheduled Volume at each California Point (PPSM) equaled the usage volumes billed to all customers delivering to East of California delivery points.

Provide comments to the entire distribution list in this email no later than Thursday at 1pm.  

Omaha - I will separate each tab and save as a separate Excel file using the file name convention as defined by the FERC.  I believe we need to provide both a hardcopy and a CD.  Is the current Excel format with headers acceptable for the hardcopy version?   Additionally, do I need to delete the headers for the electronic files on CD?  Unless otherwise instructed, I will email the final version of all four files for final disposition by Regulatory in Omaha no later than 3pm.  Please advise if there is anything else needed from Houston.

	 


Thanks,
Elizabeth

Subject:	Infrastructure Prevents...


All,

Recent events have had us reporting virus outbreaks and outages which have impacted business and communications.  With these incidents, we have had several meetings to discuss communications in times of crisis to ensure consistent, validated content and appropriate mediums to use for that content.  All to ensure everyone impacted is notified timely with accurate status.

Since Friday (09/21), there have been three (3) incidents that have confronted our environment which did not impact our business due to our fault tolerance, pro-active measures and relationship with Enron Networks.  All of these incidents could have had a serious impact to our business, so I thought it important to communicate these incidents and how they were handled which prevented any business impact.

09/24 - 25:  W32.Vote.A@mm virus
Working with Enron Networks, we were able to patch all servers and workstations in ETS Houston and Omaha, ETS Field Operations, Azurix and EOTT.  Below is a URL which conveys the damage potential this virus has which we avoided.  Teams had to work through the night, but the end result was no business impact.

http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/w32.vote.a@mm.html

09/22:  Power hit at Ardmore Data Center Facility

During the morning of Saturday, lighting struck near the Ardmore data center facility knocking out all power.  The battery backup systems assumed the system load while the generators came on-line.  The Ardmore facility ran on generators through the day until power was re-established with Reliant.  ETS' production SAN and the majority of our production database servers reside at Ardmore.  No systems were affected.

09/21 SAN Drive Errors

On Friday morning, one of the production drives on our Hitachi SAN reported drive errors.  The SAN phoned home for support, a support technician was dispatched and the drive reporting errors was replaced within 1 hour, 20 minutes.  Upon the detection of drive errors, the SAN engaged an on-line hot spare as a replacement which assumed the function of the drive with errors.  The drive was replaced, data replicated back over, and we were back live in our original configuration.  It is important to note that new devices have an infant mortality rate for initial errors detected after shipping.  This rate usually occurs within 60 days of production go-live.  Impact to the business:  None.

These are 3 examples where our infrastructure withstood incidents.  I believe this communication is just as important as the communication we all desire in times of crisis.

Thanks,
-Scott."

Darrell will call in this afternoon to give us an update as to how long they think they may be down. So until repairs are made Kermit will be unavailable. A posting was put out showing to be down till Oct. 1st. The only point that this affects is Jal Sid Richardson and you will not be able to flow gas from Hobbs to Jal."

    of topics he caught in the second break out session.  Thought I
    would go ahead and pass them on to you.  Thanks. Lynn

I have no names for the questions or statements.
 
1. NSP wants to be set up for Confirmation by Exception.
2. Improve how soon we post system problems and include EDI customers.
3. Storage allocation should show injection or withdraw allocation in the Batch Schedule Status screen.
4. Provide Scheduled Quantities reports by date range in a format for downloading in to Access database. 
5. GAS in Place is a moving capacity target, needs to be a 24hr number.
6. Cut notice should include the cut code.
7. Previous cycle cut codes do not show up on the final report.
8. Improve phone coverage from 7:30am until noon by CSR.
9. 8am Gas Control meeting interfeers with phone coverage, we should make sure to minimize how many reps. attend the meeting so phones are covered. Customers like assigned CSR.
10. Customers said cut notices are getting out consistantly.Customers would like cut notice by LE. 
11. When are measured volumes final? Water vapor factor is figured at month end and customers should include in there montly calcualtion.

Harassment Avoidance Training

To contribute our personal best at Enron, our conduct must promote respectful and co-operative work relationships.  Workplace harassment conflicts with Enron's vision and values and violates Company policy.  Harassment also can violate federal and state laws.  By understanding what harassment is and its potential harm, we can prevent it in our workplace.

During this training you will:
Be able to recognize harassment
Learn to take precautions against being harassed
Learn to avoid being considered a harasser
Know how to address a situation involving harassment
Learn how harassment prevention is consistent with Enron Values

Go to <http://elm.enron.com> to sign up for the session of your choice.  Harassment Avoidance is listed in the Compliance Category.  If you have problems registering or have any questions, please call 713-853-0357.

The date and times available for sessions are:

Dave heard back from Terry Spencer of OneOk today that OneOk has changed its position on a couple of key issues.  First, Terry indicated that OneOk now agrees that the arbitration award is not limited in effect to just the past period.  They agree that the award interprets the measurement agreement, and that the interpretation is not limited to just the retroactive effect.  It is not clear how broad they think the prospective effect of the award is, but any change is significant on this issue.  Second, Terry indicated that OneOk is very likely to ask for a special test of the meters as a way of resolving the April-May issue, and, implicitly, the issue of whether the meters are OK going forward. This is also a big change, as OneOk has refused to call a special test since the initial demand letter we sent them last Fall.  

Spencer indicated OneOk was drafting a letter that would clarify their position.  In light of that, and of the apparent progress Dave made, Stan has agreed we should hold off on the demand letter until we see their letter.  Once Dave gets it, we'll all take a look and decide the next step.  Thanks.  DF

Pamela,
I have 6 electronic tickets that were issued for travel on Continental on
September 26 through the 28th, 2001.  These travelers were to attend the
Southern Gas Association (SGA) Energy Accounting and Marketing Services
Conference in New Orleans.  Due to the Terrorist attacks, the conference was
cancelled.  I realize the date 9/26/01 falls outside the deadline for
allowing re-issuance of tickets with non-refundable fares without penalty or
administrative fee.  However, these Enron employees have asked me to
approach Continental on their behalf and request that their tickets be
re-issued to attend the conference on its rescheduled dates (January 16-18,
2002) without penalty.  I will be happy to supply a copy of the
cancellation/reschedule notice sent out by conference director, or any other
supporting documentation that might suffice.

The six travelers/ticket numbers/prices are as follows:
BLAIR/GRACE LYNN / 005-7033562204 / $136.30
CALLANS/NANCY / 005-7033562205 / $136.30
MCDANIAL/JANET / 005-7033562232 / $136.30
JOHNSON/ALICE / 005-7033562301 / $136.30
HERNANDEZ/ALBERT / 005-7033562313 / $184.45
HANAGRIFF/RICHARD / 005-7033399204 / $104.75

Thank you in advance for anything you may be able to do to help these Enron
travelers.

All best,

	Virgil, I wanted to say ""Thank You"" for your time and effort given to our new employees
	as they toured your facilities in Vidor on Tuesday, September 25.  I know it was the first
	time most of them had been to a compressor station and they found it very interesting. 

	This was one step in our efforts to help them match the Physical world (Operations)
	with the Paper world (Nominations, invoices, etc).  

	Please pass on my ""Thanks"" to the others that contributed to this educational process.

	Lynn Blair

	Shelley, FYI.  Drew, Britt and I are meeting with the So. Central Team on Monday,
	October 1, at 10:00 a.m. for 30 minutes.  It is not the best time for everyone, but it
	was the best way to get the most people and get the meeting ASAP.  We will leave
	a person on the team to cover phones, plus the North end team is going to help
	watch the phone for that 30 minutes.  Thanks. Lynn

At our meeting yesterday on the Bushton settlement proposal, Phil Lowry led an interesting discussion on the meaning of the ONEOK measurement agreement as interpreted by the arbitrators.  That discussion highlighted the fact that there are still some subtleties about the agreement that may need to be reinforced for those people who have dealings with ONEOK at Bushton.  I'd like to volunteer Britt or myself (whichever is available) to crash your next staff meeting and take a few minutes to discuss the agreement and make sure we are all on the same page.  Rick and Lynn were involved and can help outline scenarios and how they should be resolved.  Thanks--pls let me know when and where (and whether I need to bring donuts).  df   "

 There are only about 10 people left on 41 and there's still enough food an=

I recommend this wording...

ETS is in the process of evaluating the feedback and system requests from the NNG Winter Operations meeting.  A system enhancement to notify shippers when they have nominated to an alternate receipt or delivery point that is not on their contract is on the list for consideration.  The requirements for this modification are currently being determined, however, the exact method and wording of the message has not been finalized.  It is anticipated that the enhancement will be installed in the first quarter of 2002.

Robert Bryan has elected to leave Enron as of the end of September.  Consequently, his last day with us will be today.
 
He has accepted a job offer with Reliant Energy in Houston and will start working for them as of Monday.  Robert will be closely working with two familiar names - Tom Acton and Leon Williams.  We wish him well.
 
Robert shared his intentions with me earlier this month.  However, he had asked that I refrain from announcing his departure until everything was finalized on Reliant's end.  With all that is going on in the world, this process took a bit longer than both Robert and I expected.  And as a result, I was unable to communicate Robert's decision until now.  
 
I will immediately start the process of filling the vacancy created by the loss of Robert.  My current desire is to fill it as an entry-level.

Subject:	Transwestern Capacity Release Report - 9/2001

Attached is the Transwestern Capacity Release Report that provides information for September 2001 invoicing.  The spreads to the California border narrowed during the month of September.  Therefore, two of the three index-based packages released by PG&E (Core) are below TW's max tariff rate and the third should be billed using the floor defined on the offer ($0.4455/dth), which does exceed the max tariff rate.
TW Schedulers - I have left a copy of the flash invoices (processed as of late Friday) for all capacity release transactions and global settlement contracts in Amy's chair for your final disposition.  I have flagged all which may require some additional review/correction on your part.  I will be on a flight out Monday lunchtime for customer training and will not be back in the office until Thursday.  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me by pager (800-718-0830).

Subject:	Flowing Gas -  Internal UAT & External Beta testing complete: 09/28/01

UAT was completed today, 09/28/01.   

All accounting reports are now ready for migration to the Business Objects Production environment effective 10/01/01.
Note: 	Per discussions.....Please implement fix to resolve issue with the GISB Code hyperlink before 10/01/01 production date.

Beta testing also concluded on 09/28/01.   Feedback from all participating beta testers was received.  Also, there were four beta testers (shippers) who were willing to participate in the NNG Beta test.  (Utilicorp, U.S. Energy, Nebraska Public Gas, and Virginia Power)
  
In summary, the overall comments were positive and the general reaction of beta testers is that they were ""rather impressed with the progress that had been accomplished by NNG.""  Detailed customer comments by report type including any ""suggestions"" will be forthcoming.

Thanks.

Legale and Larry.

Treasury, SAP, and GCP have been working together for a number of months to resolve payment issues.  During this time, Treasury has been reviewing each wire transfer manually.  It is now time to move to the next step and allow our banking system to provide these edits and focus our attention on just the wires that fail the edits.

Treasury has partnered with GCP and SAP to quickly resolve any vendor master and data entry related issues.  This team will be working with business units as needed to expedite the correction and reprocessing of payments to meet the commercial needs of Enron.

Before you write the request, please make these clarifications:

1. If we allocated during timely,  then don't allocate again during any intraday cycles,
    do we count that as being a day that was allocated ?
2. Ventura receipt and delivery are currently being allocated separately, and not netted against 
    each other like everything else.  Does it count if  either side got allocated ?
3. If a point is in a group that is being allocated, but the point itself is not, does it count ?
4. Percentages ?

Toby, does Northern track the number of days and associated percentages that a point is allocated during a heating season?  We are trying to do a transport deal and the customer asked how often we allocated POI 5532 (Eagle) and POI 192 (Ventura) last heating season.

Drew, I won't be available until around 5pm today.  In lieu of a meeting let me leave you with some comments.

?	I have no objection to the ""special test"" being conducted at the CEESI facilities in Ventura, Ia.  As far as I know they are adequate. But, we would want to have an expert look at them first.  i.e., Instomet and Ken Cessac.
?	When a meter is removed from service at the Rich/Lean Inlet/Outlet then the Rich/Lean plant(s) would have to go down until that meter is tested and reinstalled.  I would assume that they would want to have one outage for all four meters and the total down time for the plant might be several days.
?	Northern will have to restrict C6+ again during this outage.
?	There is no spare meter(s) or spool for any of the Bushton meters.  If OneOK were willing to reimburse NNG (regardless of test outcome), NNG would be willing to purchase and fabricate spare meter spools in order to conduct this test with minimal impact to plant processing.  There would still be an outage of the Bushton Plant but probably only a couple of days.

I'd like to get the above group together to discuss our response to ONeOk's letter calling for a special test. The agreement requires us to ""cooperate"" with OneOk when a special test is called, and there are a number of issues we will need to cooperate on, including what to do for measurement while the meter is removed, which outfit to use to test the  meter, and what the standards for testing the meter should be.  Emily--pls get a meeting set up for today if possible.  All-I suspect I've inadvertently left some key people off this distribution, so please route as necessary.  DF"

?	Northern will have to restrict C6+ again during this outage.
?	There is no spare meter(s) or spool for any of the Bushton meters.  If OneOK were willing to reimburse NNG (regardless of test outcome), NNG would be willing to purchase and fabricate spare meter spools in order to conduct this test with minimal impact to plant processing.  There would still be an outage of the Bushton Plant but probably only a couple of days.

John, per your request price for front and back lamination is .70 cents for color copy and $20/ 1 hr. for lamination which is 50 copies per hour.
I was not able to get an exact price on mouse pad however I was given an estimate of $15 to $20 depending on amount ordered.  I have left a message for Karen in graphics and am waiting for reply.

Lynn and Steve,
How hard would it be for someone in the logistics group to develop and distribute weekly a report on all of the NNG interconnects and the imbalances of all of the ones that we receive a report of the noms from scheduling.  I am talking about a report like TW gets from Richard Hanagriff that gives all of the imbalances.   This would help Gas Control to keep a better idea of where we are with the other companies.  I have had other gas controllers ask me this same question.  Thank you both for your time and trouble in looking into this for us.

                                              Sincerely,

                                               Margaret Hall"

Richard Johnson faxed me a letter yesterday, wanting me to advise them on
how to proceed with this past due account.  There seems to be a lot of
misunderstanding about this that needs to be cleared up.  Johnson say ""the
Young's are due to be cut off today.""   Also in a copy of a letter they
sent to me they gave the Young's your work phone number (Richard).  Was
that OK?  I do not want Johnson giving out my work number to any customer!
Maybe if the Young's would just sent a partial payment we could get to the
bottom of all of this?
Let me know if you need me to do anything.  I can fax you copies of what R.
Johnson sent me if it will help (give me a fax number) or you can call me
this morning before 10:00.

Thanks,
Danny Kelley

Lynn,
Any luck getting a copy of that July Bushton report for me?  It was the one that showed who was scheduled at Bushton with Rate Schedule data so we could see who was flowing interruptible either from a receipt point to the inlet to Bushton or from the outlet to Demarc.

Subject:	Questions on MDQ 

	Ranelle, John and Michelle,  thought I would send this statement to you and see if this
	helps simplify our answer to your question.  

	The question is:  How is MDQ used in the nomination system to ensure we do not
	double up on MDQ volumes when we have split paths (i.e. nom on same contract
	from (1) Mid 15 to Bushton Inlet and from (2) Bushton Outlet to Demac)

	For Nominating purposes:

	MDQ of contract = Primary Firm + Alternate Firm up to the MDQ. 
	Anything over the MDQ will be Overrun and charged at the IT rate.

	Point MDQ needs to be considered when allocating a receipt point.

	EXAMPLE:

	If the Field MDQ is 10,000, then we will  (1) total the reciepts nominated on the
	contract; (2) compare the total nominated to the Contract MDQ.  Then the shipper
	will get firm (primary and alternate) up to their contract MDQ.  Anything over will be 
	overrun at IT rate.

	If anyone has any other questions, please let me know.  Thanks. Lynn

Lynn,

In reviewing the Duke contract 27291, I did find that the rate was not correct for four months in the past year.  I also reviewed Duke contract 27349 since it also had the same type of alternate to California deal.  Two months on the second contract were not billed correctly.  If Marketing can input the correct rates into the system, I can regenerate the invoices and bill Duke immediately.  Please see the attached file for details.

Thanks,  Bert

	Team, I realize this rate change is done in Marketing.  But, you have a responsibility
	to review the invoice to ensure that the adjustment to the price has been made if
	there is alternate deliveries.  Let's be proactive to ensure we have accurate billing.
	If you have any questions, please let me know.

This adjustment will result in approximately $7800 in additional revenues.  

One way to prevent this situation in the future would be for the rep and or myself to ensure that Duke's rate has been increased when they have alternate deliveries to the border.   If these alternate deliveries exist and the rate has not been increased then the rep needs to bring this situation to the attention of the marketer.

FYI - In working to load rates for the FERC California reporting requirements, it appears that for the last four months Duke Energy T & M contract #27291 has not been billed the incremental fee of $0.06/dth for alternate deliveries to the Cal Border (over and above the base discount negotiated for the contracted primary points).

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Dave Neubauer received a voice mail message today from Terry Spencer in which Terry stated that ONEOK will be forwarding the withheld mmbtu reimbursement payments for the condensate removed from Northern's Mt. Jesus drip.  Dan, please notify the rest of us when payment is received.

As an aside, note that last week CP Energy and Touchstone Trucking met with our Ron Brickman and others after identifying themselves as, a new condensate marketer and drip hauler retained by ONEOK to begin collecting the Mt. Jesus, Fowler, Sublette locations.  It is our understanding that these folks were brought in by Oneok on a trial basis to collect drip at locations that have been a ""problem"" for/between Oneok and its current hauler.

	Robert, we have decided to send Donna Scott and a person out of Brad's group to
	attend this training.  Then they will come back and do the training with each of

Subject:	GISB Version 1.5 Has Been Posted

Version 1.5 of the GISB standards has been posted to the GISB Web site.  The next step in the process is for the GISB office to send the standards to the FERC.  The implementation date of the standards is set by the FERC.  You'll be notified as this process progresses.

Electronic copies of the version 1.5 standards books can be downloaded directly from GISB's Web site (www.gisb.org/frameset.htm).  To locate the books, click on 'STANDARDS' in the menu on the left-hand side of the screen.  The version 1.5 standards books will be located at the top of the page.  You'll need the ETS logon ID and password.  Please call Alma Carrillo (-36503) if you need the ID and password.  Please remember that this is an ETS' ID and password -- it is for the use of ETS' employees.  (NOTE:  The posting for the EDM standards book shows a date of November 15, 1999.  This is only a typo on the Web page.  The actual book is dated June 18, 2001.)

Paper copies of the version 1.5 standards will be available.  Early next week Alma Carrillo will distribute a form for requesting paper copies.  We will coordinate this effort for the Houston people.  I'll let you know the coordinator for Omaha.  You can also print the standards directly from the GISB Web site.  

Please let me know if you need help obtaining the standards books or have further questions.

Thanks,
Theresa"

	I would like to recap my understanding and the ""To Do's"" from the meeting yesterday.  

		1.  After November 1, Measurement would NO longer adjust any TBS physical
	                 volumes unless there was a PPA directly influencing said TBS.

		2.  Measurement would check  to see if they had a deduct meter they were
	                 using in the end user process. (Since the meeting we have discovered that
	 	     the deduct meter IS in GVA, therefore no checking needs to be done).

		3.  Gas Logistics would check with IT on possible enhancement (if necessary) for
		     negative volumes to the TBS.  (We have talked with IT and this would be
		     a major enhancement and have to be done with the new system).

		4.  Procedures need to be documented to handle negative numbers created by
		     the LDC giving measurement an end user actual volume greater than the 
		     TBS connected to NNG.

		5.  Measurement and Gas Logistics agreed that all measured volumes including
		     End User point volumes would be ""housed' in PGAS.

	After further discussions in Gas Logistics, our recommendation is that neither Measurement or Gas Logistics accomodate a
	negative number.  If the LDC gives measurement an end user volume greater than the TBS the following should happen:

		1.  Measurement should either:

			a.  Call the LDC and let them know they cannot accept a volume at an end
			     user point higher than their TBS.

			b.  Or Measurement can call Jodie Floyd on the Gas Logistics Measurement Desk
			     and Jodie will call LDC with the same info.

		2.  If Measurement does not get an answer before measurement close, then measurement will
		     use the number equal to the TBS for the end user point.

	Gary and Ellis, you may want to have more discussions on this topic.  I would be glad to regroup if you want.
	I have put a call into Marketing to talk to them about our concerns on this issue.  Also Raetta and Jodie are
	 going to go ahead and call Wisconsin Gas and get their explanation of why an end user point would be
	greater than the TBS.  Hopefully it is just a measurement error.  We will let you know the outcome.

	If there is something I missed, please let me know.  Thanks. Lynn

We have been under burning at the Great Lakes - Carlton Interconnect for the past few days.   Gas Control was seeing what appeared to be a good flow rate but due to a calibration error between our Seimens Controller at Carlton and the Great Lakes computer we have actually been under burning.    The Control Tech - Roger Salmi - is performing a calibration now and we should be sync'd up with Great Lakes this afternoon.

I have passed this to Gas Control and they will make the necessary adjustments to correct the imbalance once Roger has completed the calibration.

Alma- please make the appropriate meter station remarks for both Sept & Oct volume statements that the down time was confirmed by Tony Simpson in case Gas Logistics calls and says otherwise----.Our volumes look good for both months so far and we should not be changing anything.

Mike thanks for the info. We show a few hrs on the 4th starting @ 3 AM but the majority begins around noon

Just heard from Jim Westbrook and he confirmed that our meter is OK - the plant was down for expansion so the 0's are good.   Should start seeing some volumes with the gas day of the 4th.

Bill Anderson with U.S. Energy was convinced that they had been taking gas during this time.  Tony Simpson with Exol confirmed that they had not.

Will close the ticket.

Looks like we lost the meter pulsar signal or module on the 25th - No measurement since.    Passed to Jim Westbrook - Owatonna Team.   Will need to get Sep. volumes to GMS for accounting close.

I passed to Bill Anderson with U.S. Energy.

	We have reviewed the assignments Jean sent out earlier in the week.  At this time
	I think the split is OK.  I would like for you to put in writing for me the following:

	 	Who is your back up on critical reports, etc when you are out.
		I would like for that back up to be someone that was NOT on
		your original team.  This may help us address the issue of the two
		""old"" teams merging.

		For example I am assuming if one rep has the shipper business and another rep has the
		operator business for the same company, then those two reps should back each other's
		desk.

		Randy Janzen is backing up Jean Adams desk on Lamar Power Plant since he has AEP which
			is shipper that does business at the Lamar Plant.

		Scott and Kathy support each other's desk since Kathy has ElPaso as a Shipper and
			Scott has ElPaso as Operator.

		Harry and Joe support each other on Oneok since Harry has Bushton and Joe has the
			gathering

		The areas of concern in relation to day to day business are below and need specific back up
		reps. 

			GPM Monthly Pricing Report
			Lamar Power Plant True Ups
			PVR Report
			Oneok Gathering Reporting
			NNG Administrative Contracts
			SPS Power Plant True Up
			Conoco Power Plant True Up
			MOPS Daily Report
				
		The HIgh profile shippers/Operators that need specific back ups are as follows:

			Duke/GPM
			Oneok
			Transcanada
			Dynegy
			Reliant
			ElPaso
			West Texas Gas 

	If there is any confusion with the email, please do not hesitate to call Terry or myself.  Thanks. Lynn

Gas Control we need to call  Mid Am by around 5:45 P.M. (Intra day 2 process) to see what their intention are on Quad Cities and Cedar Rapids points if they are outside their 20,000 plus 5% of their order. ETS scheduler should call you around this time to see if we need to allocate them based on the information they have given you. Also be sure and log this conversation.

Hasan,

The new Service Requestor Report does not have operator information and the Scheduled Quantity Report does have the operator option.  We need to discuss this further before making a decision to turn the old reports off.

All,
some time back we implemented shipper and operator scheduled quantity reports in TMS that were designed to replace the ones that existed at the time.  Since the format of the new reports was slightly different from the old ones, the idea was to wane users off the old ones.  Unfortunately, that has not happened and we are in a situation where we are having to maintain two set of reports that are used for same information.

At this time we would like to take the opportunity to turn off the old reports as part of changes implemented on 10/13.

I agree with Hasan, changing the ""Scheduled Quantities Report"" to ""Operator Scheduled Quantities Report"".  Leave the meter bounce off the name since the meter bounce is an internal option only.

The view in TMS that is used for submitting shipper scheduled quantity reports is also used for submitting Meter Bounce Report and Operator Scheduled Quantity Report.  I agree with Maggie, Terry and everyone else who has pointed out this fact and also that the new scheduled quantity reports are available only for shippers.

My recommendation will be that we remove the ability to submit the old Shipper Scheduled Quantity report and leave in place the ability to submit either the Operator Scheduled Quantity or Meter Bounce report.  Below is a snap shot of options currently on the TMS launcher

 << OLE Object: Picture (Device Independent Bitmap) >> 

I would also suggest that we change options on the TMS launcher.  Where it currently says 'Scheduled Quantities Report' change it to say something like 'Operator Scheduled Quantity/Meter Bounce'.

thanks

Subject:	JDF Walk for a Cure!



    
Well, I can't believe another year has passed, but it has.  Sunday, October 28th  is the Juvenile Diabetes Walk for a Cure! Again this year, I'm recruiting walkers for my team or simply asking for your support.  I know you hate to hear those pleading calls for more of your money, but I'm going to ask anyway - most of you know me well!  You see I have to.  As an insulin dependent diabetic myself, it is my obligation to do what I can to support every effort to find a cure for this disease which affects so many adults and children!  I know many of you see me deal with this disease everyday as I face it each time I put food in my mouth.  I follow my meals religiously with a shot of insulin along with several finger sticks a day to check my blood sugar.  It was only 4 years ago that I was diagnosed with diabetes, but your dollars are making a difference.  Within 2 years, they are expecting to be able to release insulin that can be inhaled which would eliminate the painful injections.  

I know that you have been inundated with organizations seeking your support to fund their projects and this has been especially true this year, but I hope that you will consider JDF one of the few that you continue to support as I do.  Please consider joining my team or one of the many other Enron teams and help us find a cure for Diabetes!  An Enron JDF t-shirt will be given to each walker or sponsor who contributes $25.00 or more!  If $25.00 isn't in your budget, you can purchase a ""JDF Shoe"" for only $5.00 and it will be posted at the Big E Caf? on October 26th.  As always, your contributions are matched by Enron!  Thanks for your support and I hope to see you on the 28th!

Sheila, good to hear from you.  The meeting went very well. although I was very nervous about this one.
Good response from the customers.  We had approximately 80 customers at the meeting.  I think
that is a record.  Call me when you feel like it and I tell you more.  Hope you are feeling well.  Thanks. Lynn

All,

The presentations have been posted to NNG's ""Download"" Site at <http://www.nng.enron.com/dob/etfr_downloads.html> at the bottom of the page. These presentations will be hard to email due to the size of the them.  My suggestion would be if a customer wants to save the presentations on their PC, the easiest way to do this is:

1. Right mouse click on the presentation link
2. ""Save target as""
3. Pick the directory where you want to save it
4. Click on ""save""

This will download the presentation or presentations they wish to save to their PC.

Thx,

Toby"

Lynn,
We lost our discussion leader for the ""mismatches during ID2"" topic.  Are
you interested in leading a discussion on this issue?  I think it is
important as there is no GISB solution and we have to deal with this
everyday.  Kathy Royal was going to discuss El Paso's solution, but all of
the El Paso and CIG people had to cancel.
Thank you,

	Todd, I am looking forward to the meeting in October as well as

Theresa Hess is now in the ETS Gs Logistics

Please add Theresa on any future emails.  Her

Lynn,
I don't think the discussion will be too formal.  I was thinking that you
could introduce the topic by talking about the history and background and
the situation it has put your pipeline(s) in. Our goal is get people to
understand the root of the problem, get them to understand how different
pipelines are affected by the problem depending on far they are from the
supply. Then we could go around the room and ask people about their
experiences with the problem and how they are dealing with it.  What do you
think?

All:  

As part of the TW Negotiated Rate Settlement Hearing, it has been suggested that the following modification to CAS and other associated systems be made:

EBB sytem that allows a shipper interested in capacity to simply enter a receipt and delivery point; the system will automatically let the interested shipper know how much, if any, capacity is available (advantage: although it doesn't provide the IS's the ""last look"" auction their looking for, it at least provides an open process for anybody that is interested to find out if capacity is available (eliminates any claim of ""tortious process""); disadvantage: feasibility and cost are unknown at this time).

This was drafted by an attorney without considerable consultation with Gas Logistics.  

A settlement offer that includes minor tariff changes will be provided to the parties in the proceeding this week.  Although this will buy some time, a scope and cost estimate needs to be determined so that if the modification above is offered, we know what the cost is.    

Alma:  Please schedule a 1 hour meeting with anyone on the distribution and if anyone else should be included, please let Alma know.  

Brad

FYI - In working to load rates for the FERC California reporting requirements, it appears that for the last four months Duke Energy T & M contract #27291 has not been billed the incremental fee of $0.06/dth for alternate deliveries to the Cal Border (over and above the base discount negotiated for the contracted primary points).

Please let me know if you have any questions.

   Lynn,
   I don't think the discussion will be too formal.  I was thinking that
   you
   could introduce the topic by talking about the history and background
   and
   the situation it has put your pipeline(s) in. Our goal is get people to
   understand the root of the problem, get them to understand how different
   pipelines are affected by the problem depending on far they are from the
   supply. Then we could go around the room and ask people about their
   experiences with the problem and how they are dealing with it.  What do
   you
   think?

      Lynn,
      We lost our discussion leader for the ""mismatches during ID2"" topic.
      Are
      you interested in leading a discussion on this issue?  I think it is
      important as there is no GISB solution and we have to deal with this
      everyday.  Kathy Royal was going to discuss El Paso's solution, but
   all
      of
      the El Paso and CIG people had to cancel.

         Todd, I am looking forward to the meeting in October as well as
      meeting you.  I wanted to let you know
         ETS would like to add one more person to list for the meeting.
      Theresa Hess is now in the ETS Gs Logistics
         group and I think it would be beneficial for her to attend.
      Please add Theresa on any future emails.  Her
         email address is theresa.hess@enron.com.  In talking with
      Sheryl, I think you are all booked up for the
         Sunday activity, but Sheryl put Theresa on the list in case of a
      cancellation.

         One topic I wouldl ike to talk about at the meeting:  is the
      ""mis matches"" across interconnecting
         pipelines at the Intraday 2 cycle.  This is still a concern for
      the Enron pipes and I wold like to know
         if anyone has come up with any ""great"" ideas on minimizing these
      mismatches.  If you would like
         to discuss further, please call me (713) 853-7637.

         Have a great day and I look forward to seeing you on October 21.

	Terry, please review and let me know if this sounds OK.  Thanks. Lynn


	We met with SoCal today to discuss the changes SoCal is making for
	November 1.  Here is a high level recap in relation to impacts on TW:

	1.  SoCal will NOT set the capacity at needles lower than 750 unless
	     they have operational problems. And they will maintain 750 for a gas 
	     day (during all cycles).  (Good news for TW)

	2.  SoCal may set a capacity higher than 750.  If they do, they will
	     maintain that capacity for a gas day (during all cycles), unless there
	     are specific operational problems. (Good news for TW)
	   
	4.  SoCal will have the option to call OFO's at the beginning of each cycle
	     for the gas day.  Today they only call an OFO before the gas day begins.
	     Starting Nov. 1, they can call an OFO anytime before a GISB cycle,
	     including Intraday 1 and Intraday 2 which are cycles in the gas day. (This
	     will be a major impact to SoCal's customers)

	5.  SoCal says the ""windowing"" is gone.  But, they are still giving us a
	     capacity and TW will continue to do the allocation if nominations
	     exceed their capacity.

	6.  SoCal can still reduce the scheduled volumes after an allocation.  This
	     would be due to SoCal's market not burning their schedule.  At that
	     time SoCal will confirm down to the market burn.

	Overall, our process does not change. If you have any questions, please
	let me know.  Thanks. Lynn

	Charlie, let me try calling Delaine in the morning and ask her who is next
	in the chain of command I should visit with on this issue.  Let's see what
	kind of a response I get.  If that does not work, then Mike or Shelley
	may need to call.  I will let you know.  Thanks. Lynn

Lynn,

Do you want to contact Delaine or should I.  In light of Stan & Dave Neubauer's, ""get disputes on the table and settled quickly"" direction I believe we need to bump this up a notch!  Should Mike Nelson or Shelly Corman call/write Greg Phillips?

Too much partying yesterday -- so I didn't finish my homework.  I'm still working on the slides and probably will be during the Commission meeting.  So I'll send them to you by 10:30 AM of so.  If you are available to edit them during a working lunch in my office let me know."

	Penny and Michelle, I met with Larry Berger, Terry Kowalke and Raetta Zadow this morning
	to review yesterday's meeting on the concerns for DDVC's at ""small customer delivery points""
	on the southend of NNG's system. Through our discussions, here are a few ideas including some
	of yesterday's discussion.  These ideas may be somewhat out of the norm, but we thought we
	would at least  throw them on the table.

	1.  If Oneok cannot supply these deliveries, then Oneok should agree with us to lift the requirement
	     that the supply has to be upstream of the delivery in the Bushton Universe.  It can still be
	     required in the ""Bushton Universe"", just not as restrictive as it is today.

	2.  If Oneok cannot supply these deliveries, then Oneok should allow us to do storage true ups
	     at 8:00 a.m. at the end of the gas day to eliminate DDVC.

	3.  If these deliveries are on Firm contracts, can we sell them SMS to cover these small volumes
	     even though they are in the field area?

	4.  Richfield Storage point - (I am not sure it is even active)  -  Could we get Oneok to agree to 
	     allow true ups if we are supplying the true up with gas coming from the Richfield storage point?
	     I am sure this alternative would need to include the storage group.

	We would be glad to participate in any future discussions.  Thanks. Lynn

Subject:	RE: Transok Offsystem Fuel Accounting Procedure

	I have reviewed to orders issued by FERC.  They state ""Pipelines acquiring upstream capacity without prior Commission approval will be ""at-risk"" for the cost of that capacity"".  This means that Northern will need to track both the costs and revenues associated with offsystem transactions.  We believe that in tracking the revenues we can track by contract.  

	Therefore, I believe in the meeting that if we needed to track these transactions Sue's group would maintain a manual spreadsheet for all off-system transactions.

	We also said Dan Fancler would need to review and determine how we would track the revenues thru the accounting side.  

	I believe we have provided the answers we committed to in the meeting yesterday for today.  I plan to meet with Lynn B. tomorrow to discuss nominations, contract approval processes and other stuff.....  I'll let you know where we are as things develop.  thanks MW

Subject:	Transok Offsystem Fuel Accounting Procedure

Based on our meeting 10/9/2001, I would like to propose the following accounting procedures for expensing in-kind fuel.

Case A:  In October 500,000 dts moves offsystem with only 486,000 dts expected to be returned to NNG in January.

NNG moves 500,000 dts from physical inventory to Offsystem inventory. No accounting entry made to the G/L.

Gas Accounting would reduce Offsystem inventory 14,000 dts to reflect in-kind fuel reduction in the same month the next NNG gas purchase transaction occurs (FIFO inventory method).  Reducing the Offsystem storage will cause UAF to increase, however purchasing gas for Operational Storage and not recording it to Operational Storage will offset the UAF increase.  If the next gas purchase transaction occurs in December at $3.00 then we would reduce Offsystem Storage Inventory by 14,000 dts in December production.  December UAF would not be affected.

Recorded in December:
Debit 858 3rd Party Transport exp		14,000 * $3.00 = $42,000
	Credit A/P							($42,000)

Procedural Note:  All Third Party Offsystem storage statements must be forwarded to Gas Accounting (Dan Fancler) in order to reconcile the Physical to the Books.  Reconciling items such as in-kind fuel reductions will be reported to Storage Marketing noting that purchases for in-kind fuel replacements are needed.

If NNG purchases 100,000 dt for Operational Storage in December, then 14,000 dts would be carved out as in-kind fuel replacement and recorded to 858 (3rd party transport), the remaining 86,000 dts would be recorded as Operational Storage purchase and encroachment.  We may wish for the vender to issue two invoices.


Case B	 In October 500,000 dts moves offsystem, NNG purchases the in-kind replacement on Transok's system and 500,000  dts is expected to be returned to NNG in January.

NNG moves 500,000 dts from physical inventory to Offsystem inventory. No accounting entry made to the G/L.
NNG does not reduce the offsystem physical inventory.

Recorded in month of purchase on Transok's system:
Debit 858 3rd Party Transport exp		14,000 * $3.00 = $42,000
	Credit A/P							($42,000)

In both cases all transactions are recorded outside of operational storage, but gives Marketing some flexibility on when the in-kind replacement takes place but still follows a logical methodology (FIFO replacement).

Earlier this year I requested that the Enron litigation unit file suit against Oasis Dairy for collection of unpaid transport bills on TW.  The suit was filed in the fifth judicial district court in Chaves County, NM.  

On October 1, 2001, TW was granted summary judgement in the case by the court in the amount of $29,250.56 inclusive of back interest and attorney fees.  This amount will continue to accrue interest at 8.75% per annum until paid by Oasis.  

If you would like a copy of the judgement, please let me know.

Lynn, that tariff sheet is just one small paragraph and makes a pretty general statement re: Off-System Services so maybe I don't have the latest sheet yet (or that was their intent to be pretty general) - my sheet is dated August 1, 2001.

Rick and Lynn,

I just wanted to give you an official memo that the NNG Flowing Gas Documents are now online with both the Reservation, Commodity, Variance and Imbalance invoices and their supporting documents.  NNG Customers are able to view both the Aug and Sep 2001 accounting month reports.  The customer can also view the 5 original Flowing Gas documents (Contract Imbalance, Shipper Imbalance, Invoices (Reservation and Commodity only), Allocation, and Measurement Information) from May 2000 to Aug 2001 accounting months via a hyperlink to Actuate.

During the next couple of months, I will still be working with the NNG reps and customers on various issues regarding the Flowing Gas reports: for instance, researching why the customer cannot access certain documents.   I will also be meeting with Legale and IT weekly on enhancements to Flowing Gas that are needed.

See me if you have questions.

Chris,
Gary Anderson has implemented a change request for reporting volumes to the customer. The requested change would have the volume statements round the same as the daily extract files.
There won't be adjustments made for the June volumes, instead, when the change goes in, the volume statements in June will reflect the rounded volume.
I don't know the exact time estimate for this change but it won't be in before the July close. You will be hearing more about this in the future.
Thanks to ya'll for being so patient with us.
Jeff

Gary,
I hope I have stated this correctly and if you have any comments they would be greatly appreciated.

Jeff,

Last month  after our Commodity close NNG has had customers calling with differences in the volumes we reported verses the volumes that Gas Measurement reported for the month of June 2001.  I think you are aware there  is a rounding issue with the volumes due to the decimals in the new PGAS system.  I don't know if this problem has been resolved or not but since July's close is quickly approaching I was wondering if you could give me the status on this problem and also if there will be adjustments made to the June volumes in PGAS to reflect the same volumes that we reported to our Customers? We appreciate all the efforts that you and Gas Measurement have made to make this transition period as smooth as possible,  thanks  for your assistance and I'm looking forward to hearing from you.

In our effort to decide if we need to re-negotiate contract 101021 and 101073 with Duke to possibly eliminate the BTU Daily Gas Wire numbers and instead use the Gas Daily numbers, I have attached a spreadsheet that gives the Gas Daily and BTU Daily Gas Wire numbers for Mid 13 and Demarc.  Randy, could you please run the Gas Daily numbers in your calculation for the last 13 months?  We would like to see the bottom line impact between using the BTU Daily Gas Wire publication vs. the Gas Daily publication.  We are hoping this will give some insight on whether it would be beneficial to us to re-negotiate the 2 contracts. 
Thanks,

I would recommend that we just have them nominate it out when it is convenient for TW and not charge them any additional fees.  Is there a procedure in place that will prevent us from missing a balance like this again?

In analyzing shipper imbalance statements, Laura Giambrone discovered a PNR balance of 10,000 Dth on the above noted contract. The balance was parked on TW on April 26, 2000 and PNM paid a $0.03 per Dth/d fee in that month . TW has not billed PNR fees on the balance since May 1, 2000. PNM has not inquired about nor nominated the redelivery of the quantities held by TW.
How should this matter be handled?

Dan, do you have access to Debbie's spreadsheet statements?  If I can be of any assistance, please let me know.
Lynn, I left a message with Sherry Rodgers requesting all stranger gas statements dating back six months.

Each month I receive run statements from third party vendors showing volumes
of condensate purchased during the month, I also receive field tickets to
match up to the statements.  In regards to the Mt. Jesus location, we do not
receive such documentation.  We have no way to distinguish if any volumes
were purchased from Mt. Jesus since we do not receive statements, nor
tickets.  Our trader, Jon Hanna received a spreadsheet showing volumes NNG
believes we owe for the Mt. Jesus location.  Can you send me the
documentation NNG is using to come up with these volumes.

Thank you,

Subject:	US Energy Carlton Request


As you know, USE is agent for a number of small Carlton sourcers.  They have contracted with a single supplier to bring gas in at Carlton for all of USE's clients.  USE wants to bring each shipper's Carlton obligation gas in on the shippers' individual contracts.  Normally, the supplier would have to confirm separate nominations for each little shipper.  Debbie Burgess at USE asked Diana Porter if there was a way that the USE Supplier could nominate the gas to a single USE contract at Carlton, then USE would nominate the Carlton gas from that contract to all the little Carlton sourcers for whom they are agent.

I talked with Steve & Dari.  They did not feel there was any tariff/legal obstacle to letting USE do this, as long as the contract
can only be used to facilitate the Carlton sourcing obligation.

I talked with Terry Kowalke & Gerry Medeles.  The simplest approach would seem to be an Administrative contract (non-revenue) where USE's supplier would nominate deliveries to the Admin contract and USE would nominate gas from the Admin contract to its clients' individual firm contracts.  

Based on those conversations, I told Debbie that it sounded like we could work something out.

Problem:  Later, Gerry Medeles determined that, because Carlton has special scheduling logic in TMS, 
it will require at least 2 weeks worth of system changes to accommodate US Energy's request.
With the current work load, Gerry didn't think IT could get the changes made by November 1 
but may have something in place for December.

Should we pursue?

Rick and Lynn,

I just wanted to give you an official memo that the NNG Flowing Gas Documents are now online with both the Reservation, Commodity, Variance and Imbalance invoices and their supporting documents.  NNG Customers are able to view both the Aug and Sep 2001 accounting month reports.  The customer can also view the 5 original Flowing Gas documents (Contract Imbalance, Shipper Imbalance, Invoices (Reservation and Commodity only), Allocation, and Measurement Information) from May 2000 to Aug 2001 accounting months via a hyperlink to Actuate.

During the next couple of months, I will still be working with the NNG reps and customers on various issues regarding the Flowing Gas reports: for instance, researching why the customer cannot access certain documents.   I will also be meeting with Legale and IT weekly on enhancements to Flowing Gas that are needed.

See me if you have questions.

		In our effort to decide if we need to re-negotiate contract 101021 and 101073 with Duke to possibly eliminate the BTU Daily Gas Wire numbers and instead use the Gas Daily numbers, I have attached a spreadsheet that gives the Gas Daily and BTU Daily Gas Wire numbers for Mid 13 and Demarc.  Randy, could you please run the Gas Daily numbers in your calculation for the last 13 months?  We would like to see the bottom line impact between using the BTU Daily Gas Wire publication vs. the Gas Daily publication.  We are hoping this will give some insight on whether it would be beneficial to us to re-negotiate the 2 contracts. 
		Thanks,

Subject:	Ft. Buford Measurement Facilities Agreement - Comments


I went over my Ft. Buford example with Scott.  He is comfortable that the present arrangement is fair to Border.
He was also concerned that NNG should not get into a problem with fuel.  Based on my conversations with Dan Fancler and my knowledge of the PRA process, I believe that fuel is being properly accounted for and retained (assuming Marketing believes that Bearpaw really is selling the gas to other shippers on NBPL who will bring an equivalent amount of gas back to NNG at Ventura or one of the other NNG/NBPL interconnects.)

I'm confused about the proposed Measurement Agreement vs. what we are currently doing.
It appears to change what is currently happening.  Do we want to do that if we think the current arrangement is working?
If so, we need to talk to Dan about how the accounting would need to change.

Paragraph 1:

During the month, the same number is scheduled & confirmed as received at Ft. Buford and delivered to Border, 
with no reduction for fuel & unaccounted for.

When actual measured volumes are available, the total quantity of gas measured through the suction side meters (WBI plus Bearpaw meters) is the quantity deemed to have been received into Fort Buford.  For the  (Bearpaw & whoever is coming in thru WBI), whatever is measured on the suction side is deemed to be delivered to Border with no reduction for fuel.
Any difference between metered receipts and scheduled volumes goes on NNG's OBAs with Bearpaw and WBI.

However, for Border, the actual quantity deemed delivered out of Ft. Buford and into Border is the total receipt quantity LESS 1.66% fuel (which may be change from time to time to reflect the configuration and operation of the station) .  

Paragraph 3.
Northern, not Border, does the fuel calculation.  NNG's measurement system takes the total quantity of gas measured thru the suction side meters less a use and unaccounted percentage (currently 1.66%).  The result becomes the quantity delivered into Border at Ft. Buford.

The calculated fuel amount is booked by Dan Fancler/Kasey Davis as part of the Market Area fuel consumed and is recovered under the PRA as part of NNG's Market Area fuel rate.  

Do we need to provide Border with a month end summary of fuel used if the number we use for their actual delivered volume does not include fuel?

Paragraph 4
(This doesn't affect the agreement, but it's something NNG should consider.)
If NNG makes changes at Ft. Buford to increase the capacity as proposed, won't we need to recalculate the appropriate fuel rate?

Paragraph 5
NNG does not need to reimburse Northern Border for use and unaccounted gas since we deduct the fuel from the number used as the actual delivery to Border at Ft. Buford.

Any difference between the deliveries scheduled into Border and the actual metered volume (less fuel) is booked to the NNG/NBPL OBA at Ft. Buford, netted with amounts on OBAs at the other NBPL/NNG interconnects  and settled in-kind at any of the Parties' interconnects (usually Ventura).

GENERAL
The advantage that I see to the present method is that the volume on the delivery meter at Ft. Buford into Border 
is realistic in that its volume is the receipt volume less our best guess at what is burned at Buford for fuel and never
really reaches Border.

I went to the eye doctor this morning and my left eye is looking great, better than he expected.  Since I am able to see 20/30 he decided to forego the temporary contact on my right eye and proceed with the surgery on the right eye.  He has scheduled me to have the Lasik surgery on my right eye this Friday, the 19th.  

If this causes a coverage problem, Robert has volunteered to come in early.  If there are any concerns please let me know.

Subject:	Marketer for Post Rock Gas

Joni, I was wondering if you could find out for me who the Marketer is for Post Rock Gas.  The reason I would like to know is they are the last hold-out shipper as far as signing their extension agreement so that we can send them their Rate Case Refund invoices which are dated September 1, 1999.  I would like to see if a Marketer could call them to see if we could get them to sign so that we could finally get the last of these invoices sent out and cleared from our accounts receivable account.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thanks,

Raetta"

Thanks for the clarification, Larry.  I don't think we need to meet to discuss this issue.  I guess that I just misunderstood your initial message to imply that certain documents were still unaccessible to customers.  I'm satisfied.

Rick and Lynn, 

A customer can access all of NNG accounting documents( all invoices and their supporting documents).  However, due to tighter security coding in Business Objects compare to Actuate, reports are now only viewable by one party, instead of two parties. For example, at a poi where there is an agent and an operator, the agent is only able to view the Measurement Info, Daily Volume Allocation and Allocation statements.   IT is researching a fix to a situation like this.

If you still would like to meet with me to explain further, give a demo (or have  lunch meeting with just the three of us!), let me know.

Thanks 
Larry

Rick and Lynn, 

I just wanted to give you an official memo that the NNG Flowing Gas Documents are now online with both the Reservation, Commodity, Variance and Imbalance invoices and their supporting documents.  NNG Customers are able to view both the Aug and Sep 2001 accounting month reports.  The customer can also view the 5 original Flowing Gas documents (Contract Imbalance, Shipper Imbalance, Invoices (Reservation and Commodity only), Allocation, and Measurement Information) from May 2000 to Aug 2001 accounting months via a hyperlink to Actuate.

During the next couple of months, I will still be working with the NNG reps and customers on various issues regarding the Flowing Gas reports: for instance, researching why the customer cannot access certain documents.   I will also be meeting with Legale and IT weekly on enhancements to Flowing Gas that are needed.

See me if you have questions.

Lynn,

I got a call from Dan McVay, the senior commercial guy at Williams Field Service this evening, and he relayed a request from his scheduling group in Tulsa.  They would like to visit with the team involved with the scheduling and nomination process for MOPS on Monday, Oct 22nd., probably most the day  This is in anticipation of their assuming responsibilities for the system.  They would like to observe the process and the procedures we go through everyday to administer the pipe. They will still require an interim period whereby we provide these services for them until they modify their computer systems, but this visit will allow them to qualify the task that they need to capture, and let them see what system changes they will need.

Thanks,

John, Please don't kill the messenger, but Lamar Power called along with CMS Marketing today asking that the Scheduled Quantities Report please be reinstated.  This report included receipt and delivery volumes, a summary, as well as, Month to date information. The new report gives them very little to work with and a lot of information they don't need on this report.

	I think it would be very prudent to put something on the WEB.  We talked about this at the
	Winter Ops meeting and it would be good to have another reminder.

	John, would you work with Michelle and Bill to get a posting on the WEB since I will be
	out of town.  Thanks. Lynn

	Bill & Lynn - What do you think of Ranelle's suggestion regarding a notice on the Website?

	Linda - Will these points be inactivated in the POI system effective Nov. 1?  

	Please advise  MW

Michele,
I just found a note that I had written to myself about posting on the web site a notice to remind the Reverse Auction shippers that effective Nov. 1, they wouldn't be able to nominate to the Reverse Auction point anymore.  It may be worth it to check with Bill Fowler and/or Lynn Blair to see if they think this would be beneficial.  Do you want to follow up on this?

Northern is close to a Settlement with our customers involving Carlton and the SLA.

This will entail some special invoice processing.

We expect to file revised Reservation, TI Commodity and Carlton surcharge rates to be effective November 1, 2001.

However, the filing probably won't be made before November 1 and we aren't likely to have approval until the end of the year.
That means that November will be billed at the existing winter rates and 
we will need to do a 1-month refund in January to rebill November at the new rates.

We hope to have approval in time to bill both Reservation & Commodity correctly for December.  But, on the Reservation invoice, we may need to do a late ""preliminary"" run to pick up new rates, depending on when we receive an order from FERC.

    We can make the meeting Thursday afternoon if that is better for you guys.  It will
    be short because there is not a whole lot to discuss.   Rick, FYI, Shelley postponed her meeting
    until 10:00 in the morning so she could listen in on FERC meeting.  Possible means they do
    not have a final ruling as to what direction we are going, but she wanted to give us a ""heads
    up"" from a system perspective.  Hopefully that helps.  See ya'll in the morning.  Thanks. Lynn

Rick/Lynn, we have very few MPS contracts with imbalances and if we do, they are relatively small - Larry B. takes a look at those each month. Because of Close and since we will see Imbalance invoices and DDVC invoices for the first time, tomorrow is always a very busy time - we also may have some last minute measurement corrections to make so I would prefer to have the meeting in the afternoon if we have to have it tomorrow.  Just let us know the criticalness of this and we'll work around you and Rick's schedules.
 
Thanks,
 
Raetta

Lynn,
 
9:00 may be a bad time for you and I if Shelley has her normal Wednesday staff meeting.  With everything that has gone on today, I believe she will want to meet.  8:30 may be a better time if you are available.
 
Does possible mean probable?  Or was it just a theoretical conversation you had with regulatory affairs?  Esther/Larry should be able to run a report showing us the MPS volumes on contracts.  I do not believe we will find very much volume.

        I talked with Mary Darveaux and there are some possible billing changes  coming that 
        we need to discuss in the morning. 

        1.  There may be a 10 day lag on pricing 
        2.  The MPS imbalance volume will be taken out of the tiering denominator 
                calculation. (as well as fuel) 
        3.  We need to run a report to see how oftern (if at all) we have had imbalances on MPS contracts. 

        Do you have any time Wed. morning?  What about 9:00 a.m. in my office?  If that 
        doesn't work we can look at tomorrow afternoon.  Thanks. Lynn "

	I talked with Mary Darveaux and there are some possible billing changes  coming that
	we need to discuss in the morning.

	1.  There may be a 10 day lag on pricing
	2.  The MPS imbalance volume will be taken out of the tiering denominator
		calculation. (as well as fuel)
	3.  We need to run a report to see how oftern (if at all) we have had imbalances on MPS contracts.

	Do you have any time Wed. morning?  What about 9:00 a.m. in my office?  If that
	doesn't work we can look at tomorrow afternoon.  Thanks. Lynn"

	I'd like to confirm that we have a green light from you to do a prototype of the TMS report that we discussed yesterday. Depending on the complexity of the data it should take us 1-2 weeks to finish a prototype of the report, the universe, and the TMS integration piece. Please let me know if you are ok with this. If the answer is yes, who do we charge our time to?

Subject: Aberdeen and Welcome

Lynn/Karen:
 
The November 1 termination of the reverse auction point on Northern will increase the probability of priority mismatches at Aberdeen and Welcome between our two systems.  
 
We have already received questions asking how we will confirm these points after the 1st.  And our response has been that we would expect the restricting party to dictate who can and cannot flow at these locations.  
 
One party that has been surprisingly quiet so far has been Mirant.   Mirant should be very interested in how we will allocate capacity at these two points on November 1, simply because their contracts have the greatest risk of not being scheduled.  They are the only firm shipper on Northern Border that have Aberdeen and Welcome as contracted path end points.  And as you know, they supplied the reverse auction point.   But from what we have heard on the street, they are not actively matching up their supply with those markets who were allocated reverse auction capacity on your system.  That is why I feel the odds are high for a capacity mismatch.
 
Mirant does have a couple of options with their Welcome contract on Border; they can drop some of their Welcome gas off at a secondary upstream point, such as Marshall.  But their Aberdeen contract needs to flow at either Aberdeen or Warner on our system.  And if their capacity is stranded at Aberdeen on the 1st, I am confident that they will be giving both of us a call.  
 
Between Aberdeen and Warner (our alternate delivery point to NWPS), we have the ability to deliver into this area an aggregate of over 70 MMcf/d.  If we do see firm and interruptible gas nominated into these points in excess of this amount, I feel Northern Border must zero out the interruptibles on our side - that was the issue that created so much heart burn for Pan Alberta years ago when we were forced to allocate Ventura.  But that is as far as we are planning to go.   We view the flow restriction to be on your side.  And we are suggesting that your priorities be used to allocate Aberdeen on the 1st. 
 
If we do a firm allocation based on Border's priorities before we confirm, we would have a definite mismatch, and potentially nothing would be scheduled at the point.  Now that would not be all bad, given that we could use such an opportunity to deliver off the large OBA imbalance gas due NNG at the point.  But I don't think we want to fire up a battle with the shippers on both sides of the fence; we'll deal with Mirant on our end.  
 
As for the Aberdeen OBA imbalance issue, I am still trying to come up with a long term solution to deal with that situation.  Any ideas as to how we can effectively eliminate the imbalance would be greatly appreciated, especially given the fact that the Energy Affiliate NOPR suggests that the flexibility we may have today could be restricted in the future.

		Ladies & Gentlemen:

		At Dave Neubauer's request, I am going to schedule a meeting for tomorrow to which you are all invited (and if I have left out a necessary participant, please let me know) to formulate a response to ONEOK's letter of October 16 to Dave (a copy of which I will circulate to you).  It has to do with the proposed special test.  I will have my a/a, Lee, circulate copies of (a) Dave's letter of October 5 and (b) ONEOK's reponse of October 16 to you all immediately.

		Given that so many schedules are involved, I went ahead and picked a time that both Drew and Dave have open: 4:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m tomorrow, Thursday, October 18.  Debbie has reserved the video conference rooms in 49C2 and in Omaha.  Lee will get a call-in conference number for anyone that can't attend in person, and e-mail it out to you.

		I appreciate your patience.	

		Many thanks.

		Britt"

		Ladies & Gentlemen:

		At Dave Neubauer's request, I am going to schedule a meeting for tomorrow to which you are all invited (and if I have left out a necessary participant, please let me know) to formulate a response to ONEOK's letter of October 16 to Dave (a copy of which I will circulate to you).  It has to do with the proposed special test.  I will have my a/a, Lee, circulate copies of (a) Dave's letter of October 5 and (b) ONEOK's reponse of October 16 to you all immediately.

		Given that so many schedules are involved, I went ahead and picked a time that both Drew and Dave have open: 4:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m tomorrow, Thursday, October 18.  Debbie has reserved the video conference rooms in 49C2 and in Omaha.  Lee will get a call-in conference number for anyone that can't attend in person, and e-mail it out to you.

		I appreciate your patience.	

		Many thanks.

Then we can set up a time for a conference call.  I will be in the office all week, except Thursday afternoon.

Subject:	US Energy Carlton Request


As you know, USE is agent for a number of small Carlton sourcers.  They have contracted with a single supplier to bring gas in at Carlton for all of USE's clients.  USE wants to bring each shipper's Carlton obligation gas in on the shippers' individual contracts.  Normally, the supplier would have to confirm separate nominations for each little shipper.  Debbie Burgess at USE asked Diana Porter if there was a way that the USE Supplier could nominate the gas to a single USE contract at Carlton, then USE would nominate the Carlton gas from that contract to all the little Carlton sourcers for whom they are agent.

I talked with Steve & Dari.  They did not feel there was any tariff/legal obstacle to letting USE do this, as long as the contract
can only be used to facilitate the Carlton sourcing obligation.

I talked with Terry Kowalke & Gerry Medeles.  The simplest approach would seem to be an Administrative contract (non-revenue) where USE's supplier would nominate deliveries to the Admin contract and USE would nominate gas from the Admin contract to its clients' individual firm contracts.  

Based on those conversations, I told Debbie that it sounded like we could work something out.

Problem:  Later, Gerry Medeles determined that, because Carlton has special scheduling logic in TMS, 
it will require at least 2 weeks worth of system changes to accommodate US Energy's request.
With the current work load, Gerry didn't think IT could get the changes made by November 1 
but may have something in place for December.

Should we pursue?

Shelly, Just wanted to update you on a few things.

1.  Steve and I have been asked to work with McGown and Steve Kirk on the SLA settlement.  There is a meeting in Omaha we are attending on Wed. With Mary Kay and Dave.

2.  There is a marketing issue in relation to NNG procedures on monitoring stranger's gas.  There is a meeting Thursday morning with Dave and Mary Kay. After that mtg Dari, Mary and I are going to review procedures for any changes. 

3.  I will conference in for Thursday's Customer Service mtg.
I hate not being there but I think these other meetings are big enough to have presence in Omaha

4.  The SoCal meeting was very beneficial. Only one possible variance from what we had previously heard.  There is a possibility SoCal could reduce capacity at ID2.  Pat and I talked abot TW concerns.  I will review with marketing and the team when I get back.

I love my Blackberry, but still getting used to typing on it.  Anxious to hear how the paging worked for you.

Hope your trip to Florida was good.  Also hope you can Make since of This email.

Thanks Lynn

Will you have time for lunch or dinner while you're here?  Would be great to catch up.

Also, I heard some things mentioned that people might like to see in your followup:
Along with the timeline, describe the ""macro"" of how the pipe is scheduled/balanced and then go to the detail of how contracts and rate types stack up and get matched across the pipe with up/downstream.  Also when a delivery area is constrained and when a receipt area is constrained.  (pictures may help)

Another whole session could be devoted to the allocation at billing time -- least path, penalty application, etc.

Will you have time for lunch or dinner while you're here?  Would be great to catch up.

Also, I heard some things mentioned that people might like to see in your followup:
Along with the timeline, describe the ""macro"" of how the pipe is scheduled/balanced and then go to the detail of how contracts and rate types stack up and get matched across the pipe with up/downstream.  Also when a delivery area is constrained and when a receipt area is constrained.  (pictures may help)

Another whole session could be devoted to the allocation at billing time -- least path, penalty application, etc.

Thanks, Jane

Caroline Barnes has indicated that you have a presentation put together that briefly covers the purpose and function of  Gas Logistics, and how this department  interacts with other departments. I was wondering if you would be interested in making the presentation to GMS personnel to better understand how Measurement impacts your department. Please let me know if you have an interest and when you might be available and  I?ll arrange for the conference room to be available.
Thanks-

I have some questions about data that I have been downloading from the
NNG/Enron website.  I am not sure you are the correct person to contact
about these questions but I am hoping you can help or at least point me in
the correct direction.

I am looking at three different pieces of data - Index of Customers, Tariff
information and Capacity Release data.  I am having trouble understanding
the way your pipeline works and I am hoping someone will be able to help.
One of the major questions I have is why the rate schedules differ so much
between these three pieces of data, IOC lists the rate schedules on
contracts as TF_M_11_3, TF_M_4_10, or TF_F_1_12. Tariff lists the schedule
TF with various rates under it, TF_12 base, TF_12 variable and TF5 (all
under the market to market heading), TFF under the Field to Field /market
Demarcation heading, etc. ,  and in capacity release I see rate schedules
that look different still, TF5-TF5, TF7-TFF, TF2-TF12, TFX1-TFX Mkt Apr-Oct.
I am trying to reconcile the differences and I can get a little ways but
then I run into problems.  For instance, in the IOC, I am assuming TF_M_11_3
means TF rate- Market to Market- flowing from Nov-March.  But then I see a
contract that has the TF_M_11_3 rate schedule that flows from April thru Oct
(according to effective and expiration dates of the contract) and I get
confused again.  I can correlate some of the capacity release rates to
tariff, TF5-TF5 corresponding to TF5 under the TF rate, but then I get to
TF7-TFF and I am not sure where the TF7 comes from or what it correlates to.
I know there must be some way to look at all this together, but I am at a
loss to figure it out, which is why I am asking for your help.

I have never nominated on your pipeline, but instead am just doing data
collection and analysis.  There are more questions I need to have answered
and would like to be able to contact someone so that I can talk with them
and gain an understanding of how your pipeline works.  Could you please give
me a call or direct me to whom I need to speak?  I can be reached at
720.548.5470.

One more thought - is there perhaps a ""handbook"" that I would be able to
read that might answer some of these questions for me, perhaps a nomination
guideline that you might give to a new trader/scheduler?  If so, please mail
me a copy to 3333 Walnut Street  Boulder, CO  80301.

Thank you so much for you help in this!  I appreciate anything you can do
for me.

Lynn,

I was ask to make a selection between Amy and Christine to do testing for the  new accounting project. Which will take up to 50% of their time away from the team. My recommendation to you and Rick Dietz was Christine McEvoy to be the selected individual to test on this project. If you have any concerns on this matter please let me know. Thank you. 

One more thing, could we mention this in the next team leader meeting for all the individuals involved in this testing.

I have just been informed that a wire from ONEOK was received yesterday for delinquent/disputed mmbtu reimbursement at the Mt. Jesus drip.  ONEOK had been withholding payment since April 2000.  The wire funds received not only included the $72,745.13 for April 2000 through June 2001 period  as requested in Dave Neubauer's September 24 letter, but also subsequently invoiced amounts for July and August 2001.  Looks like things are caught up and back on track.

Well, it's Mid October and I am checking on the status of the SBA Priority during Allocations.  The new contracts are due to take effect November 1, 2001, and with cold weather already on the horizon we could be headed for the same types of problems we had last  winter.

Do you have an estimated time of implementation?  Let me know if there is anything else I can do to help.

Thank you for your help.

I have worked up the requirements and the TMS IT group is evaluating the changes.  Due to the CMS implementation we would not be able to implement this change.  The earliest we might be able to implement is Mid to late October.  If you have any questions please call.  Thank you.

Steve,
Back in June we discussed the issue of the SBAs' priority during an Allocation.  The Business Development group and Contracts are in the process of making the necessary changes so that CMS can distinguish ITs associated with SBA activity from other IT agreements and are second through the meter after Primary during allocations.  For your information, below are the comments from the various people involved in this issue

Please let us know if you have any further concerns regarding this issue.  Thanks for your continued help in this matter.

I believe Reyna, et al, have held discussions with the Reg Types and received the green light to go forward, but I will confirm. 

Regarding (2.), With the new contract system being developed, the monitoring of contract provisions via the system should be do-able. I am sure both CMS and TMS will be involved in the effort.

	Mike, thanks for the update.  I have a couple of questions/comments:

	1.  Is Legal and Regulatory in the loop on these decisions?

	2.  Anything we can automate, I would like to ensure we have the automation on the enhancement

Subject:	SBA Priority during Allocations

Sue, 
During the meeting today with Gerry to discuss the SBA priority during allocations, some of the following issues came up:  (Gerry, correct me if I misunderstood anything)

If we ever call an SBA to bring in gas after the timely cycle, do we still want them to have priority over Alternate and Interruptible? (my opinion is no, they should only have this priority during the timely cycle).
If the SBAs bring in gas at a secondary point, do we still want them to have priority over Alternate and Interruptible?  (my opinion is no, they should only have this priority at Primary Points).
Are we aware that an Alternate shipper who has flowing rights from the previous day might get ""squeezed"" out of the same entitlement on a day that an SBA shipper is given priority over Alternate?  Might have some mad shippers.
How will SBA volumes be posted on the EBB if there is an allocation: Interruptible???
Because the current methodology for allocation is based on a ""point"", they don't follow the downstream, will the IT contracts currently being used have to be identified through the contracts department as ""SBA IT""?
This is for the future contracts system:  Should we ask that the new contract system to automate all the manual processes of the SBAs such as account balance and carryover days in order for the system to be able to validate this criteria?

These presentations will be hard to email due to the size of the them.  My suggestion would be if a customer wants to save the presentations on their PC, the easiest way to do this is:

1. Right mouse click on the presentation link
2. ""Save target as""
3. Pick the directory where you want to save it

This will download the presentation or presentations they wish to save to their PC.

Mike,

Kent and Tim called me this morning and said that they have received a letter from LS Power requesting compensation for costs they feel they incurred to adjust their supply due to cuts on their FDD overrun.  Their analysis applies to the period June 1, 2001 to present.  Kent and Tim need data to perform an analysis that will be used to respond to LS Power's (USES) request.

Kent has requested the following for the period June 1 forward:

A list of days where at least one cycle was not allocated (in other words, if we allocated one or more cycles of a gas day, but not every cycle (regardless of which cycle was not allocated), they need an electronic list of those days. 
 Electronic copies of each of your final month end sum sheets for June forward.

They want to answer the customer within a week, so they'll need this information at least by early next week.  Kent has requested that all of the information be sent to both him and Tim.

Thanks for your help!

The migration for reinstalling the scheduled quantities reports went well.....I tested all three pipes with K#'s and ID#'s and they came up fine.....I did this for both internal and external.

Lynn,

Just to let you know that one of the imbalances that kicked out I did figure it out(believe it or not);I have run nominated reports and scheduled quantities reports for all of Axia's contracts so that Kathy and myself can look at those on Monday to make sure everything looks alright.

The final for 10/27 I was able to figure out and everything was fine.  I will get this ""final"" down if it kills me!

John,
Karen asked me to send you a note about the problems we encountered 
with the final AM processing for 10/26.

When Karen submitted the rollover for the first time, it kicked out
two imbalances.  One, she was able to figure out with Kathy's help
and the other one she cannot.

The shipper on  K# 62418 nom 78172  at Demarc to K# 22252 during the ID2 cycle.
They were scheduled at 75177.
Shipper K# 22252 modified his gas from Demarc (from K#62418) to different storage.
However, he re-nom at the full 78172, not the amount that was scheduled from ID2,
which was 75177.  Shipper K# 62418 did not make any changes to this package.

If we just looked at the nom screen , everything is tied out.
However, we have to consider what's was scheduled.  In this case,
the scheduled number for K#62418 did not match the final am nomination
on K#22252.

After this transaction was invalidated (K#22252), the system
kicks out another imbalance, since K#22252 was realigning storage
gas to K# 22319, and we did not invalidate that change.

Karen also had some problems with not seeing the apply button.
I think Kathy walked her through the process since I did not.
We restarted the final AM process after the Timely allocation
and completed the cycle around 2pm.

Please call if you have questions/concerns.
Thanks,
Joe"

I believe this generated $75 worth of discretion with Midwest Gas.  Unless I am not seeing something here, I don't feel as though investing dollars to install EFM or Bullhorn would be a good idea.

	The charts from these locations are not received in time to process for the 5th work day close, so these daily volumes are determined systematically based on the beginning and ending index readings. Even if they were, it is impossible to determine daily volume consumption from a 31day chart. Even decreasing the chart rotation is not a solution unless charts are received by the third work day to allow sufficient time for processing. The answer is to install EFM or possibly a Bullhorn unit to determine the actual daily index readings so that the daily quantities are accurately determined.. On these types of installations, how can we assess penalties on anything other than monthly quantities ? NNG has several locations where the existing equipment does not meet today?s business needs, so we probably need to determine where these deficiencies exists, and identify the costs to resolve the problem.
	Thanks-
	Gary

			Gary, was wondering if you could help us out. Scott has told me that they have 31 day charts for the stations listed below and he was wondering why we couldn't read those so as to get daily volumes rather than taking the total for the month and dividing it by the number of days in the month to get the daily volume.  The reason for this is because, especially in the winter time, this can become very crucial when we calculate the penalty invoices which are done daily and are based on the differences between the daily physical volumes and the volumes that the shippers have scheduled on our pipe.  If these charts cannot be read daily, what can we do to make it so that they can. Could you please check to find out what we need to do in order to have accurate daily volumes for these stations.

				Thanks for looking into this for me Raetta.  I talked to Jim Banker this week and asked for him to check and see if they were charged for any penalty gas or not.  He said that he would let me know if they had.  He also stressed that we still need to see the actual daily volumes instead of average daily volumes on the volume statements.  I'm not quit sure if this part of the problem has been addressed yet or not.  Please let me know. Thanks Scott

				I have looked at the DDVC invoices for Midwest for March, 2001 which total $304.70.  The SMS charges amount to $76.30 but the biggest part of the invoice is the negative DDVC charge which is for $228.40  - this occurred on March 26.  I was wondering if the Midwest Natural Gas people could let us know what they think the volumes should be on those specific wells that they are concerned about for the 26th and then if necessary, we could make those corrections.  Please let me know if there is anything else that I can do to help.

				I recently met with Jim Banker with Midwest Natural Gas from Whitehall, Wi.  He informed me that he had some concerns about whether or not he was being charged for penalty gas for daily volumes.  He showed me some gas volume statements that he recieved from GMS.  I believe it was the month of March Statement.  What the statement showed is average daily volumes instead of the actual volumes per day. (Ex. At  Eleva TBS Days 1 and 2 showed 122 MCF and Days 3-31  showed 118 MCF.)  These are charted stations with 31 day charts.  The stations that he is concerned about are Arcadia, Eleva, Independance, Mondovi, Strum, Whitehall #1,and  Whitehall #3.  Any assistance or knowledge that you can provide me would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks Scott 612-270-8501

I was wondering if you would be interested in making the presentation to GMS personnel to better understand how Measurement impacts your department. Please let me know if you have an interest and when you might be available and  I?ll arrange for the conference room to be available.

Team,

The Bushton plant went down for abt. 24 hours from the morning of 5/26 until the morning of 5/27.  I talked with Jimmie Mosher and she said they will correct noms. for the differences on those days when everyone is back in the office on Tuesday.

The plant did not notify her that there was a problem, so a timely fix was not an option.  They called our gas control.  I found out when I did the reports for the 26th on Monday, the 28th.

Janet

Ray, Teb is right..  Beginning with June billing for May production, we are billing FTS-2 reservation invoices on
June 1 instead of May 31.  At some point in time we may move back to the last day of the month.  This would be 
after we have (1) automated the manual process or (2) managed to speed up the manual process to effectively
capture the scheduled volumes for the last day of the month.  Hope I have not confused the issue for you.  
If you have any other questions, please let me know
Thanks. Lynn

Subject:	RE: Determination of Invoice Date/Due date

Ray - The only tariff provisions state that ""Transporter shall render  invoices to Shippers no later than the tenth (10th) day of the month following the month to which the charges or credits apply ..."" (Sheet 134).  The payment provisions (also on Sheet 134) state that ""Unless otherwise agreed, Shipper shall pay Transporter ...on or before the tenth (10th) day after written transmission of ivoice..."" .
There is nothing else in the tariff which could be used to programatically determine invoice dates but the invoice due date would be 10 days after the invoice is transmitted.  In discussions with market services,  I believe that they intend to send out the FTS-2 reservation invoices on the first day of the month rather than the last day of the production month because of complications in administering some rate cap provisions agreed to in the Phase IV Settlement.  Sorry I couldn't be of more help.  -  Teb

	Teb,

	In our accounting discussions were are trying to determine the correct rules for programtically determining the Invoice date and Invoice due date.

	For reservation and commodity, is there a set of rules we can apply to determine each of these dates? Today the invoice date is entered prior to 
	the invoices being finalled.  We would like to eliminate this step.

	It appears, on reservation, the invoice date is the last day of the production month.  So for Febraury production month for example, reservation 
	invoices had an Invoice Date of February 28,2001 and a due date 10 calendar days after that, March 10,2001.

	Thanks for any help you can give us.

	Ray

Subject:	Brad Holmes Phone Number

Please, make note that the churn request below did not happen, therefore Brad will be unable to receive phonemail today.  Telecom was just here and informed me that it would take place tomorrow, May 30th.  However, they could not tell me if his phone mod would take place AM or PM.

His e-mail is working, so Alma could pass this information on to his group.

Thank you,
Ricki

John, I am submitting this online churn request #4017 as a modification to Bill Cordes' Houston information instead of a new request for Brad Holmes because Brad does not yet have a badge number. He will be assuming an existing office (EB4197) and phone number (x3-3432), previously assigned to Bill Cordes for his use when traveling to Houston. Please let me know if you need me to revise it later. Thanks!

	Todd, I am looking forward to the meeting in October as well as meeting you.  I wanted to let you know 
	ETS would like to add one more person to list for the meeting.  Theresa Hess is now in the ETS Gs Logistics
	group and I think it would be beneficial for her to attend.  Please add Theresa on any future emails.  Her
	email address is theresa.hess@enron.com.  In talking with Sheryl, I think you are all booked up for the
	Sunday activity, but Sheryl put Theresa on the list in case of a cancellation.  

	One topic I wouldl ike to talk about at the meeting:  is the ""mis matches"" across interconnecting
	pipelines at the Intraday 2 cycle.  This is still a concern for the Enron pipes and I wold like to know
	if anyone has come up with any ""great"" ideas on minimizing these mismatches.  If you would like
	to discuss further, please call me (713) 853-7637.  

	Have a great day and I look forward to seeing you on October 21.  Thanks. Lynn

Subject:	FT. BUFORD CONFIRMATIONS

Lynn,  can we setup a few minutes to discuss the Ft. Buford confirmation processes.  NBPL is wanting to discontinue faxes for Ft. Buford and the ID2 faxes for all NBPL points.  This would require either NBPL or NNG dialing into the others system to confirm (Ft, Buford each cycle) and to verify the final ID2 scheduled numbers daily.  We need to discuss if NNG is willing to make this a practice or not.  I will have Ava setup a time on your calendar some time or get with me early some morning.  We need to see what direction we want to go.

Subject:	Mt. Jesus Drip

Debbie Moseley called me a few weeks ago about the Mt. Jesus drip.  Oneok is not giving NNG Btu replacement for the hydrocarbon liquid being hauled from the Mt. Jesus location.  The imbalance is approaching $60,000, and Oneok seems unwilling to change their position.  Oneok claims that the hauler is not paying them for liquid, but is writing water on the ticket.  I sampled the liquid and sent Oneok (John Hanna) a copy of the analysis, showing the liquid as drip, not water.  In the past, I know that we did not push Oneok on this issue because of the Bushton measurement dispute.  Now that the Bushton measurement dispute is near settlement, should this Mt. Jesus issue be addressed?  There are at least two other Oneok liquid issues that need to be addressed:  1.  Oneok is receiving payment at Hemphill #3 for liquid, and this gas does not go to Bushton (Sammy Williams may have more detail on this issue).
2.  Sublette liquid is condensate, and it is being called water on the ticket.
Do you have any ideas on how to proceed?  We do not seem to be able to get the issue resolved at this level.  Thanks.

The South Central team would like to update you regarding our current statu=
s with Ruthe and Jamie's departures:

We understand you will be visiting with us regarding the changes within our=
 team with Ruthe and Jamie's departures.  With Ruthe and Jamie's resignatio=
ns, our team is now comprised of nine schedulers and two accountants.  We a=
re interested in learning if we will be allowed to fill at least one positi=
on.  Ruthe has been such a valued team member and will be sorely missed -- =
not only for her expertise in allocations and scheduling, but in her partic=
ipation in holiday/weekend coverage.  Jamie's participation in the holiday/=
weekend coverage will also be missed.  Of course, their daily presence in h=
andling the telephone calls and participation in team responsibilities are =
also missed.  Since our team rotates the evening position in order to distr=
ibute that responsibility throughout the nine schedulers,  we will miss Rut=
he and Jamie's participation in that as well -- this amounts to approximate=
ly five weeks annually each.  With the reassignment of their evenings along=
 with holiday/weekend coverage, we are basically looking at a rotation of o=
nce every third weekend.

In the interim, we understand Randy has provided a list to you with the sug=
gested reassignments of Ruthe and Jamie's accounts.

We are hopeful we will be allowed to fill this position on our team and we =
look forward to visiting with you.

Thank you,
South Central=20

Subject:	Transwestern Invoicing

I have attached a spreadsheet that Elizabeth put together for us for our February invoicing so you can get an idea of the categories and the number of invoices.

These are the 7 categories Elizabeth checks, and how they can be redistributed:

Void Invoices: There are only two of these invoices each month, MSR's can check these, but Marketing will have to communicate when there are additional Invoices that need to be voided.
Delete Line Items: This can also be checked by MSR's but new contracts with these exceptions need to be explained by Marketing to the corresponding MSR for that customer
Volume Adjust: These are also only for exceptional contracts, MSR's can check these exceptions, but Marketing will have to explain exceptions on New Contracts to the corresponding MSR for that customer.
Make-up Volume: MSR's
Adjust Reservation Invoices for change in Credit for Commodity due to make-up: MSR's
Adjust Rate: Marketing
Regenerate Invoice: MSR's

 

We will start checking these for May Accounting,
The TW Team

Jodie - I have been meaning to give you a call.  I will be in Houston on Wednesday and was wondering if we could get together to visit for awhile.  Since we did a formal interview earlier I don't think we need to go back through the same stuff but, would like to get an update on what you have been doing.

It is going to be hectic tomorrow so I will have Rosemary give you a call to set a time.  

RY - Please set this up one hour for Jodie and I.  The other meetings planned for the day are NGPL and another meeting I need you to set for Mike Stage, Dave Neubauer and myself.  We will need 1.5 to 2 hours with Mike.  

Thanks.  John

John,  I responded to the job you have posted.  Due to my promotion in February in Market Services it is a policy that I typically would not be allowed to respond to posted openings for a year.  I visited with Lynn this morning and expressed to her that I would like to respond to your opening.  Lynn agreed to let me respond.  Also,  Lynn has requested that you contact her if there is any interest in an interview.  She wants to make sure her t's are crossed and i's are dotted.  If you have any questions please give me a call @ 713.853.1465.

Tammy - after further investigation I found that someone did activate a request on 4/25/01 that was effective for 4/1/01. There were two requests going on at the same time.  I don't know why it was activated on the 25th for the 1st - we normally do not do that - I will check into it.

The MDQ on this contract did not change on 4/25/01.  A change was made in the CMS system on 4/25/01 to change the MDQ EFFECTIVE 5/1/01to 53,000.  The MDQ for the entire month of April was 30,000.  
There were no retroactive changes made on this contract.

 Terry,

You raise an excellent point.  First, let me clarify that when the change to the point mdq was input on 4/25, it was made retroactive to 4/1.  The TMS revalidation caught the change and made the adjust on 4/25/01 because this is the day the change was made in CMS.   TMS doesn't currently have the functionally in place to retroactively change scheduled quantities because of a retro change made by the upstream system.  The question is why was this change allowed by the upstream system?  Is there any business reason why we are changing contract data retroactively?  Is the current policy working?    We should probably get Rick involved get some of these questions addressed.

Regards,

Tammy

Subject:	RE: K#22585 (UTILICORP) APRIL, 2001

The revaildation worked for 4/25, but does not do anything to the prior days in the scheduling system,  unless we manual schedule it accordingly. Do we have any flags in the contract or scheduling system to keep us from back dating a contract to the first of the month, if prior days have scheduled volumes greater than the change made to that contract? In this case their were 13 days of 5,000 scheduled above the contract MDQ, which should be scheduled as overrun and billed at that rate.

Raetta,

The pointMDQ was lowered on this contract on 4/25 at 10:07AM.  If you look at the Scheduled Quantity by Cycle Screen you can tell that the volume was lowered on the ID1 volume for 4/25 with a CQC reduction reason code (revalidation code).  They then changed their nom volume for the rest of the cycles.

If you have any questions, feel free to call me.

FYI, Could you let me know why Utilicorp could schedule 35,000 at POI 3054 from 4/12 thru 4/24 when their MDQ was only 30,000.

Due to the manual billing required with Phase IV, we will delay the billing process
by one day.  We will mail out May Reservation invoices on June 1 instead of
May 31, 2001.

The team will track the time it takes to accomplish billing for May.  After that time we 
will deterime how June production will be billed. 

If you have any questions, please let Hilda or I know.  Thanks. Lynn

Lynn, how would we handle this Accounting wise? Since it went through our meter, the customer is going to get credit for this gas and transportation, which he should not. We need to get this situation stopped. They should blow gas upstream of the meter.  Gary, can you check with Bandel and get an approximate volume that has been vented? Richard, great job in bringing this to our attention. sj

It was brought to my attention this last weekend that when Warren Eunice goes sour and our valve shuts, there is a blow off valve down stream of our measurement that Warren  personnel are using to vent the sour gas until it turns sweet. So, while they are venting the gas we still show flow of 8,000 to 10,000 which is measured as if we received the gas. I have notified Bob Bandel and he is looking into the situation. They were not aware that this was happening. Richard brought this to my attention.

Gary is right.  But if NGTS is the only contract, they will take the swing.=
  Or is Pioneer saying they
want to take the swing?  If Pioneer wants to do the swing, maybe they could=
 do a contract to
cover the swing volume only?  Karen and Larry, what do you think?  Thanks. =

Subject:=09Request for OBA at South Texas Team POI

NGTS called me yesterday morning indicating that they were buying gas from =
Pioneer Gas Pipeline Company and receipting it at POI 401 (Gains Co. #2) fo=
r 6/1/01.  NGTS indicated that Pioneer Gas Pipeline Company wanted to buy b=
ack 100 Dths of this gas at POI 78163 and the system would not allow it.  I=
 pulled up POI 78163 only to discover that it was not a legitimate POI on N=
NG and that POI 401 was a receipt POI only.  I then went to Gary Spraggins =
to verify if their was a POI that NGTS could delivery gas off NNG for Pione=
er's compressor.

Received a call from Tim Green and Cindy White at Pioneer Gas Pipeline Comp=
any (915) 655-3300 explaining Pioneer sent in an agreement form to create a=
 new interconnect to take gas off NNG and mailed NNG a check to cover this =
expense.   I t went to Linda Trevino to see where we stood with this new ag=
reement.  Linda indicated that she had not activated POI 78163 as she did n=
ot have a reference contract.  I called Pioneer and they indicated that NGT=
S would be the only supplier at this POI.  I called Darren Brown at NGTS an=
d he informed me that he would be using contract 107903 to deliver gas to P=
ioneer's compressor starting 6/1/01.  I gave the contract information to Li=
nda and she activated the POI and it defaulted to active confirmation.  I c=
alled Tim at Pioneer and asked him if ""active confirmation"" was what he rea=
lly needed and he indicated that he would prefer ""confirmation by exception=
"".  I had him fill out ""NNG Request for Operator Choice Form"" and fax to me=
.  Linda  changed the operator option for Pioneer to reflect ""confirmation =
by exception"". =20

Tim Green asked if they could set up an OBA at POI 78163 as the compressor =
would not necessarily use the 100 Dths nomed daily?  I had him send an e:ma=
il request to Zula Carter and myself indicating POI 78163 be added to the O=
BA at POI 401 Gains County #2.   This e:mail request must be approved and Z=
ula Carter will advise us when this takes place.

I got involved in this as I schedule for NGTS although I realize POI 401 is=
 on the So TX Team and assigned to Janet.

If I you have any questions feel free to call me.

Wanted to give everyone an update on the status of the new report format for the
morning meeting:

	The report is completed for all information except:

		Storage
		Operational Capacity
		Current and Accum Imbalances

The group working on this feels they will have all pieces of information 
available and the report completed by June 15, 2001.  The above referenced
fields have been a challenge to get  the data base populated as needed.  But this
group has done an excellent job in striving to give us an accurate report and not
giving up on possibilities.

As you are aware, Gary and Darrell have already started using the report
and we have changed how we report outages and allocations.  Storage will
change once the new report is completed.  

Don Powell and Dale Ratliff have been an excellent resource and very helpful to
ensure we get the product we need.  

If you have any other questions or any concerns about not getting the new
report before June 15th, please let me know.  Thanks. Lynn"

I put a stored procedure on etsadhoc...adhoctest.  It is called jlowry.storage_report.  It expects two parameters, 1. the gas date and 2. the service type (FDD, IDD, or SBA).

I believe the calculations are what you requested in your document.  I have not worked on the swing calculation because I'm not sure I have access to all the required data.  Also, I think you probably want the scheduled withdrawal to be a negative number so you'll get the net when you add injection and withdrawal together.  I essentially changed your net calculation to be injection - withdrawal, rather than adding the two together.  If this is wrong, let me know and I'll correct it.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Alice,
the information you need from TMS can be found in the etsadhoc database of ETSADHOC server (ETSADHOC.ets.enron.com; ip address: 172.30.10.144).
Depending on whether you need nomination or scheduled information, you will need to query against either the Nom or Sched table.

Let me know if you need more information

Thanx

I need to identify where certain storage and imbalance information reside on the  adhoc server. The attached document lists the data that is needed and where the data is in TMS. The next step is to identify which database stores the required information. 

Esther Dasilva has done some research and  found that part of this information is on the NNG adhoc database. We need your assistance to complete the mapping of this data to the adhoc tables. Can you meet with me and Esther on Tuesday to direct us to the correct path on mapping this data (see attached)?

Thanks,

I sent service award plaques to you Friday, June 1, for Diana Porter and Karen Clapper.
The plaques should have been enclosed in a presentation case.
However, O.C. Tanner did not include the presentation cases in their packaging of the service awards.

The presentation cases should be delivered to me this week.

If you would like to hold off on the presentations, I will forward the cases to you

I apologize for this inconvenience.

Tangie, very good letter.  I am assuming this does not include the PVR OBA, but all others.
Is that a right assumption?  Thanks. Lynn

Subject:	Oneok's OBA Balance Thru April 2001


Jerry,

Attached you will find the Oneok OBA spreadsheets which identify the cumulative OBA imbalance
through April 2001.  In order to balance to your monthly Confirmation Letter that Northern sends I 
have made some changes to the spreadsheets to make it easier for both of us to identify the 
cumulative imbalance by contract.

As per our phone conversation the Burdett (17378) point was sold to Golden Belt Transport, LLC, 
effective 2/1/01 but, the imbalance volumes are still being placed under your OBA contract.  I am
working with others here at Northern to get this corrected.

Currently I have identified that Oneok owns Northern $2,401,128.62 on all the OBA contracts 
(Ellis-Woodward-Clark OBA's=$316,846.96 due NNG; Delhi Beaver OBA=$171,781.26 due Oneok;
Orignial OBAs = $2,212,211.59 due NNG).  It was stated that both parties would cash-in/out the 
imbalances on the Original OBA contracts, on a quarterly basis.  At this time I am requesting that we
cash-in/out the Original OBA's and the Delhi Beaver OBA since, Oneok no longer operates the 
point.

Please take a moment and review the volumes and dollars on the spreadsheets.  If you have any
concerns please let me know but, if you are in agreement would you please let me know when 
Northern can expect to receive payment.

Subject:	System enhancements

Maggie,

I would like to submit the following suggestions for enhancements to the TMS system.  

  	a.  For printing Source Path and Allocation Path reports during the Allocation Process, the print function 		     should be set at permanent default of legal and landscape.  This would be a real time saver when 		    checking the allocated points for uncalled for cuts.

	b.  Customers would like to have subtotals by point and a grand total  on the storage daily activity report 		     (IDD/PNR Contract Balance).  We now have the grouping to sum function, but I think this is too  time 	     consuming for our customers.

	c.  In the Scheduled Quantities listings, instead of the box which now says ""No cuts were found in this 		     cycle.  Do you want to continue checking?""  I think the notice for Final AM should be expanded to say 	    ""Did you submit new nominations for the Final AM Cycle?  If not, please view Intraday 2 for any 		     possible cuts.""  Since so few of our customers actually use the Final AM Cycle, I think this would be 		     helpful to our customers who are frequently under severe time restraints and stress when trying to 		     figure out what went wrong. 
 
	d.  I would like a serious investigation into the time required to do manual scheduling.  The slowness of 		     the system for this procedure is tortuous.   It is also a  serious time waster.

Please advise if you need further information.

Oneok Fined for Contempt by OCC Judge 
An administrative law judge at the Oklahoma Corporation Commission last week found Oneok and two of its subsidiaries, Oklahoma Energy Marketing and Trading and Oneok Gas Storage, in contempt for their refusal to provide documentation of their gas sales. The judge recommended to the commission that the companies be fined $2,000 per day retroactive to May 8 and lasting until they comply with the commission order. 
Oneok and its subsidiaries claim the information is proprietary and that the commission has no legal right to have access to its unregulated gas sales transactions. The matter is expected to go before the full commission later this month. 
OCC Public Utility Division Director Ernest Johnson called the companies continued refusal to allow access to the documents ""mystifying."" 
""They have twice tried unsuccessfully to have the Oklahoma Supreme Court stop staff in its attempt to get the documents. Now they have simply refused to turn over the documents. A paid witness for Oneok recently testified that the dealings between Oneok subsidiaries and ONG were arms-length competitive transactions, and the resulting charges were fair, just, and reasonable. One would think Oneok would be anxious to show staff that such was actually the case, and that the decisions made were in the best interest of the consumer,"" said Johnson. 
""This is simply a case of commission staff trying to get the information needed to ascertain whether the customers of a regulated monopoly (ONG) paid a fair, just and reasonable price for their natural gas this past winter."" 
John said the commission staff received numerous complaints from gas customers struggling with high gas bills this past winter. They best illustrate the reason behind the staff's request for documents from companies owned by Oneok, the parent company of ONG, he said in an earlier statement. 
""It is the Commission's responsibility and obligation to review and determine whether ONG's customers are paying no more for gas than the law allows. Staff is simply trying to do that. It is regrettable Oneok apparently does not see fit to work cooperatively with OCC staff to strengthen the public's confidence in the utility and the regulatory process. Its refusal to turn over data related to gas transactions of its subsidiaries further undermines a public confidence already badly shaken by the gas crisis.""

Subject:	Morning Meeting ""noise""

After having attended the moring meeting in Omaha the past couple of days, I need to pass along the following observations. I only included on the address list the ones that I could think of off the top of my head who regularly attend the meeting, so please don't think I've limited the list and please pass this on to the others who attend. 

The microphones in Houston are extremely sensitive to any noise. Paper shuffling is the biggest problem. Even ""straightening"" papers or turning a page has the effect of blocking out the speakers voice. Gas Dailies should be left at your desk. Whispering can also be heard. It tends to make it very difficult to hear in Omaha. It is also imperative that the microphone be put very near the person who speaking, particularly if their voice doesn't carry. I don't quite understand when it can pick up whispers, but can't pick up a softer speaker's voice, but that's the way it is. I think if we are all aware of that, we can greatly enhance the quality of the meeting for the Omaha participants. thanks sj

Diana is very much a team player and ensures all the team members' accounts are
billed accurately each month.   Diana is a very positive influence on her team.
She is the first one to bring resolution to the table on any reconciliation that needs to be done
on team issues as well as business issues.

Accomplishments -  Diana was nominated and selected for the Chairman's Award.

Alma, hopefully this helps.  Thanks. Lynn

Linda Brooks just telephoned in response to our questions regarding the lack of injection activity on the above contract as mentioned in the Gas Control Meeting this morning.  She said Kurt Batenhorst didn't realize this contract was still out there, and they will begin injecting on the 7th.

Any questions, please advise -- ext. 3-3063 -- thanks.

Kathy/Sherry - as I was looking at the imbalance invoice log this morning, I noticed that IES Utilities has priors totaling $2,036,585.73 for the production months of 11/2000 thru 04/2001 and Owatonna Public Utilities has priors totaling $144,578.68 for the production months of 11/2000 thru 02/2001.  I just wanted to make sure that these were valid before we close priors tomorrow (6/6).  Let me know if these are not valid.

Thanks,

Raetta

Kathy/Sherry - IES also has DDVC invoices for the same months totaling $6,068.55 and Owatonna has DDVC invoices for the same months totaling $160,246.75.

Steve, this is going to possible make a difference in how much gets scheduled
at Socal.  So you may see a little lower numbers at time.  Let's discuss if that

Spoke to Lynn Blair, Kim Watson, Cynthia Rivers, Linda Ward, and Terry Kowalke, we would like to hold the same 
scheduled numbers on ID/2 from San Juan Lateral as we had scheduled for ID/1 from San Juan Lateral.  
We think this will help us minimize our Operator and Shipper imbalances.  
Please let us know if we start getting complaints from our customers.  
If anyone has other ideas or comments please let us know.

Example:

Non-Grid--    San Juan Scheduled      870,000
ID/1                                                                875,000
ID/2                                                                875,000 
(we will have to do the right mouse click and update the capacity to the flow rate needed.)

Lynn, how would we handle this Accounting wise? Since it went through our meter, the customer is going to get credit for this gas and transportation, which he should not. We need to get this situation stopped. They should blow gas upstream of the meter.  Gary, can you check with Bandel and get an approximate volume that has been vented? Richard, great job in bringing this to our attention. sj

It was brought to my attention this last weekend that when Warren Eunice goes sour and our valve shuts, there is a blow off valve down stream of our measurement that Warren  personnel are using to vent the sour gas until it turns sweet. So, while they are venting the gas we still show flow of 8,000 to 10,000 which is measured as if we received the gas. I have notified Bob Bandel and he is looking into the situation. They were not aware that this was happening. Richard brought this to my attention.

Terra is building an outstanding balance due NNG on the A/R, and an explanation is in order for the sequence of events.  With the latest Commodity Close, the A/R will total $528,445.91, which includes a PPA in the amount of $171,217.80 (February).  This will be rolling on to the 30 days' Customer report very shortly.

Earlier this spring, discussions were held with Loren and Frank regarding Terra's contract #104684 and December's transportation invoice.  Scheduled quantities reports for December 2000 through February 2001 were sent for their review.  

The decision was made to repath the December Reservation in order to revise the base/variable volumes which resulted in a PPA in the amount of $175,507.80.  A PPA form was signed by all parties and forwarded accordingly.  In early March, we determined we had monies due Terra and after discussions with Loren, it was agreed we would net all invoices currently on the A/R -- this included the December PPA.   Bill Fowler had talked to TransCanada and left a detailed voicemail for Audie Bremmer, Terra.  The net monies wired to Terra totaled $295,155.36.

In late March, Loren advised us to repath the February Reservation in order to revise the base/variable volumes which resulted in a PPA in the amount of $171,217.80.  A PPA form was signed by all parties for this one as well.  There was no reason to repath January 2001.

In April, Kathy tried to telephone Audie who would not return her call.  His message to her, through his assistant (Maggie), was that he would not pay any invoice without a telephone call from Frank.  This was relayed to Loren and he relayed same to Frank.  As a side note, Frank had seen Audie at some industry function fairly recently and had tried to call Audie -- Audie had not returned his calls.  

In last week's followup with Loren, he relayed that Frank had visited with Dave Neubauer on this issue, and the feeling was that December was closed and we would waive February.  However, Bill Fowler feels February should still stand.  Loren shared there was a similar deal with Minnegasco and they had to pay the revised invoice.  If we allowed the February to be waived, TransCanada would relay that info to Minnegasco.

I plan to talk to Loren again mid-week to update this issue to see if he and Frank feel the timing is acceptable for us to contact Audie.  Should anyone have any questions or suggestions, please advise -- will be in the office 6:30 a.m.-3:30 p.m. this week. 

Thanks,
S.

The South Central Team has discussed Debra's Corrective Action Report and feel that she has met the demands we placed on her at the time the report was issued.  We have seen Debra work hard to get up to speed on our various interconnects and other procedures this year.  Debra has sharpened her focus on our business, gained competence in all areas requested, and is now able to support the team when needed.  We therefore request that this report be removed from her file. 

 Please let me know if anything more is needed to complete this updating for Debra. 

Thank you,

Janet McDaniel for the South Central Team

I realize the below referenced classes are during PRC.  I have talked with =
Frazier and here is our game plan for the
teams.  If you can attend one of the sessions below, please make every effo=
rt to attend.  If you cannot attend, then let Ava know and she
will keep track of names for me.  After the PRC process we will set up a vi=
deo  for you to watch.  It is very critical we
all attend the meeting or see the video. =20

Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks. Lynn

From Drew Fossum

The Enron Transportation Services Legal Department will present the Annual =
Antitrust Program in Houston on:

May 8=09=09EB5C2=09=092:00-3:00 p.m.
May 17=09=09EB49C2=093:00-4:00 p.m.
May 22=09=09EB5C2=09=092:00-3:00 p.m.

Refreshments will be served.

It is ETS's policy that all marketing and business development personnel at=
tend this seminar each year.  The purpose of this program is to provide a r=
efresher on basic antitrust laws and ""Do's and don'ts"" for conducting busin=
ess.  IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU ATTEMPT TO ARRANGE YOUR SCHEDULE TO ATTEND. =
 PLEASE MAKE SURE TO SIGN IN WHEN YOU ATTEND.

The May 17 session will be transmitted to the video conference rooms in bot=
h Maitland and Omaha.  As seating for the May 17 video presentation is limi=
ted in all locations, please call the following for reservations for that d=
ate;

Houston (30 seats)=09Janet Cones=09X 3-1540
Omaha (3C1-20 seats)=09Ann Smith =09X 7091
Maitland (20 seats)=09Jimmy Dowden =09X 7080=20
=09=09
Because the video conference room in Omaha will not accommodate all personn=
el, a video tape presentation will be scheduled by Dari Dornan for Northern=
 personnel and by Janet Place for Northern Border personnel. =20

If extenuating circumstances prevent any personnel in Houston from attendin=
g, please call Janet Cones (X 3-1530) to see the video tape.

Please be advised that in addition to the annual antitrust presentation, ET=
S Legal also provides an on-line Antitrust Handbook for you easy reference.=

Subject:	New Morning Meeting Report

Wanted to give everyone an update on the status of the new report format for the
morning meeting:

	The report is completed for all information except:

		Storage
		Operational Capacity
		Current and Accum Imbalances

The group working on this feels they will have all pieces of information 
available and the report completed by June 15, 2001.  The above referenced
fields have been a challenge to get  the data base populated as needed.  But this
group has done an excellent job in striving to give us an accurate report and not
giving up on possibilities.

As you are aware, Gary and Darrell have already started using the report
and we have changed how we report outages and allocations.  Storage will
change once the new report is completed.  

Don Powell and Dale Ratliff have been an excellent resource and very helpful to
ensure we get the product we need.  

If you have any other questions or any concerns about not getting the new
report before June 15th, please let me know.  Thanks. Lynn

Karen has a real phobia about spiders.  One time Karen and I and three of our team members went out to lunch.  As we were leaving the restaurant, Karen was sitting in the back seat.  I started backing the car out of the parking lot when Karen screamed.  Thought I had hit someone.  I looked back and Karen was climbing on top of Anita and Bill trying to get in the back window.  She had spotted a spider that had dropped down on a drag line.  That's when we decided to help Karen get over her phobia.  We started planting little plastic spiders in all her file folders and desk drawers.  So for the next couple years we would hear Karens little scream when she would run across our little surprise.  Think we helped her get over her phobia.  I'm sure when she sees a spider now she probably remembers her old teammates.

Karen is the official Food Monitor for the team.  She tracks the fat grams and caloric intake for those of us who can't count but love to eat.  We are always excited when she is gone on vacation because we don't have to hide our food.

Karen has done an excellent job of handling one of our most difficult interconnecting pipelines.  The customers love Karen's positive attitude and great sense of humor.

Karen carries a contagious disease called ""A love of life"" with an upbeat, positive attitude and an infectious giggle that surrounds our team.

Lynn,

I notice that Duke is taking gas from Pony Express in 16A and deilvering it to the Mid 16A - 1707 Pool, which is the pool used for only Bushton Tailgate pooling.  Since Duke is transporting and paying fuel and commodity to deliver there (rather than pooling), I am OK with this from a marketing perspective.  However, since this pool was established to separate Bushton Tailgate gas from other 16A gas, are you OK with this?  Their other alternative is to Pool to Mid 16A pool using MPS for free and then the downstream shipper would have to pay fuel and commodity when they take it away (netting a lower price to Duke).  I don't know if they are meeting some obligation for Tailgate gas using Pony gas as an option.  Let me know what you would like to do.

Thanks!

Per Terry's comments, we have the ""blocks"" in the system to prevent
any shipper from going to 16A back into the ""Bushton Universe"".  As long
as that block is in place, we are OK with Duke using 16A for pooling purposes.
Hopefully this answers your question.  If not let me know.  Thanks. Lynn

Transwestern Denies Withheld Capacity to Boost Negotiated Deals 
A Transwestern Pipeline executive yesterday dismissed allegations that the pipeline withheld firm transportation capacity bound for California from its recourse-rate shippers last winter in order to free up more capacity for contracts at substantially higher negotiated rates. 
Mary Kay Miller, vice president of rates and certificates, acknowledged Transwestern may have had discussions and exchanged faxes (prior to posting its available capacity) with two shippers -- Sempra Energy and Richardson Products II Ltd. -- that subsequently entered into negotiated-rate transactions. But she stressed that requests for capacity by Sempra Energy and Richardson were considered ""moot"" by the pipeline until after the available operational capacity was posted. 
""Even if they would have sent...a fax the day before"" capacity became available, ""it would have been irrelevant because there was no capacity posted"" at that time, said Miller. Capacity requests that came in prior to Jan. 31, the day that available capacity was posted for February contracts on Transwestern, were ""null and void."" The only ""relevant"" ones were those that Transwestern received on or after Jan. 31, she noted. 
Miller spent much of Wednesday on the stand being quizzed by lawyers for FERC and producers about Transwestern's methods for notifying customers about available capacity, the manner in which it chooses winning bids and about its pre-posting contacts with Sempra Energy and Richardson. 
It was the first day of a FERC hearing exploring charges that Transwestern exercised market power in awarding negotiated-rate contracts that led to shippers being charged as much as $27/MMBtu last February, far in excess of the pipeline's maximum allowed rate of 38 cents/MMBtu for firm transportation service to the California border. The Commission proceeding yesterday focused on four negotiated-rate contracts of Sempra Energy and Richardson for a total 45,000 MMBtu/d of service on Transwestern during February and March. 
Richardson and Sempra ""clearly did not have any 'deal' entitling them to the posted capacity before it was posted,"" Miller said in prepared rebuttal testimony. The two companies ""had the right to the capacity only 'after' they submitted their bids, 'after' the posting period ended, 'after' Transwestern determined that no other bids were submitted, and 'after' a contract was agreed upon between Transwestern, Richardson or Sempra,"" she noted. 
Despite claims made by FERC energy industry analyst Barry E. Sullivan to the contrary, ""Transwestern did not withhold capacity that otherwise could have been made available under recourse rates in order to make the capacity available under substantially higher negotiated rates,"" Miller testified. 
Sullivan, an analyst in the FERC Office of Markets, Tariffs and Rates' (OMTR) Division of Litigation, contends that Transwestern threatened to withhold capacity unless shippers agreed to negotiated rates (see Daily GPI, Aug. 29 <http://www.intelligencepress.com/subscribers/daily/news/d20010829e.html>). In fact, he believes the pre-posting discussions between Transwestern and shippers were intended to raise doubts about the availability of capacity at the maximum recourse rate, so that shippers might be more ""willing to enter into negotiated-rate contracts above the recourse rate, in the hope of securing some of the capacity if and when [it became] available."" But Miller counters that Sullivan ""offers not support for his claim."" 
She noted that even Sempra Energy and Richardson, in response to a data request by Southern California Edison, support Transwestern's claims. Both companies replied ""no"" when asked whether ""any employee of Transwestern or any Transwestern affiliate ever indicated at any time that Transwestern would not provide the capacity at the maximum tariff rate."" 
The ""capacity at issue was offered on Transwestern's web site at the recourse rate in the exact same manner that all other capacity is offered on Transwestern's web site at the recourse rate; there was no prohibition, restrictions, limitation, condition or suggestion that a potential shipper could not bid for the capacity at the recourse rate; and any potential shipper, including Richardson or Sempra, could have submitted a bid for the capacity at the recourse rate."" 
Sullivan contends that Transwestern's motive for allegedly advancing negotiated-rate transactions at the expense of recourse-rate deals was pure profit. Under questioning by Thomas J. Burgess of FERC's OMTR, Miller conceded that Transwestern earned $1.8 million from Sempra Energy's contract in March, $1.3 million from Richardson's March contract, and a ""comparable"" amount from Richardson's February contract. She noted the pipeline received a ""substantially higher"" amount as a result of Sempra's February contract, but she didn't provide an exact figure. FERC's Sullivan estimated the pipeline's profit from the Sempra February contract was more than $5 million. 
Sullivan said that much of the profits that wound up in Transwestern's coffers would have gone to Sempra Energy and Richardson if they have been able to acquire the capacity at recourse rates. But Miller countered that the Commission's negotiated-rate policy ""does not require a minimum level of profit to shippers or contemplate any hindsight analysis of whether shippers could have gotten a better deal or made more profits."" 
Furthermore, she said the Transwestern case shouldn't be used to consider changes to the negotiated-rate policy, as Sullivan has suggested. This case ""is the wrong forum for such an issue because modifying the negotiated-rate policy should only be done on an industry-wide basis so no pipeline or group of pipeline customers is competitively disadvantaged.""

    Please let me know

Scott, per our conversation this afternoon, I wanted to follow up with this
email.

We would appreicate help in ensuring NO ONE works on Gary Spraggins 
machine on the weekend.  For the last several weekends, he has come
in on Monday mornings and cannot log into the system.  Gary and
Darrell Schoolcraft are on NT while the rest of this floor (41) are
on Windows 95.  

If you need more explanation, please call Dale Ratliff or Steve January.

Thanks. Lynn

Beverly, thank you so much for your help this weekend and your offer to come into the office.  Between you, Amy and Terry
we got through the weekend without a glitch on our side (even though we had system problems).  Tracy, I understand all is
OK at your house.  I am glad to hear.  Cynthia, I understand you had some damage.  Please let us know if we can help in any
way.  Linda and Bert, were you guys OK?  Thanks. Lynn

Since most of Houston is underwater and the Weather services is anticipate more rain today, Tracy and I have decided that I  will be working the late shift tonight.  Tracy's street is flooded and she doesn't know if she can get out of the subdivision.  She and I will talk later to see if it is necessary for me to work Sunday night.

Will keep you posted.  Amy, if you need any help, please call me.

Thanks,

    I do not understand this schedule.  Where is Diana and Renee in the evenings?  Also can you give
    me the schedule for the weekends now that you have Diana and Renee on the weekends?
    Plus I would like to know what customers you gave Diana and Renee from a scheduling perspective
    and what you took away from them from an accounting perspective to even the workloads.
    Could one of you schedule some time with me and John to review the above questions?
    Thanks. Lynn

Lynn,
    The team has decided that we only need one primary evening person, which is Shirley Walden.  In the event that Shirley is out of the office, the team will use a rotational schedule between all team members to cover the evening shift.  I have attached a tentative schedule for evening coverage. If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks.

Subject:	TW Daily Imbalance Report

I would like to schedule a meeting for Thursday, June 21st to review the Daily Imbalance Report Ken Powers has been developing.  The report compares the ""paper"" volumes with the ""physical"" volumes on TW on a daily basis.  This report has been developed as a tool for managing TW's linepack.  The next step will be to develop some financial analysis tools to use in conjunction with this report to help TW make operational and financial decisions on a daily basis concerning management of our OBA's, PNR and fuel.

Please let me know as soon as possible if 10:00 would be good for you or if another time on Thursday would be better.

Subject:	question about TW operational capacity


I found your name on the site, I'm guessing you might be the best person to
lob this question towards...

I'm looking at operational capacity on this site
http://www.tw.enron.com/twdb/etfr_avcap.html
And I can input the gas day, for today or tomorrow.  But when I get results
back it is ambiguous as to which cycle the gas is flowing in.  Are they all
for the timely cycle or are the evening and intraday cycles thrown in there
as well.  And if they are thrown in there, do I just have to know WHEN the
different cycles are posted and use that as my guide (IE if I'm looking at
results around 14:00 those would be for intraday1 cycle)????

Are you even the person I should ask?

Thanks,
Brian Robinhold

Maggie - Rick is not here for ten days.   Can you get someone else to approve it such as Mike Bryant or Lynn Blair?   I really need to get moving on the NNG Measurement Desk and to be successful I have to be able to compare SCADA with EFM for the last Gas Day for NNG.

 

I will need some help on how to get to the SCADA Vs EFM actuals.   I am not familiar with TMS.

Tks - Mike W.

This is to update you on what we are doing to correct the problems we have been experiencing at this point.  Penny McCarran and I have been working together to find a way to eliminate the DDVC's that are being created at this point.  This is such a small volume point (500 dth/day or less at present) being used for irrigation only and the shipper has no way of avoiding DDVC's since there is no storage arrangements in the Bushton Universe for them to make Final AM trueups and correct their volumes.  

We have worked with Contracts to determine if this point should truely be considered a TBS or Citygate.  EFM was installed due to possible volumes of approximately 1,700 dth per day and it was concluded that makes it a TBS.  Our findings, however, show that it does not meet the TBS criteria, due to the fact there is no LDC involved at this point. We have changed the type from TBS to IC and have created an OBA contract (pending signatures) to eliminate future DDVC's and make this a feasible point to operate.  

If you have any questions, please contact Penny or myself.

FYI.  Just to keep ya'll in the loop.  This fix should be ready for test on Monday
and migrated Monday night for Tuesday's use.  This fix will be very beneficial
in minimizing Shipper imbalances on NNG.  Terry and Gerry will work with the teams
to be sure everyone is up to speed on the change.  If you have any questions while I
am out next week, please check with Terry Kowalke or Mike Bodnar.   Thanks. Lynn

FYI, with regards to item (3) below:
SBS will remain off after storage allocations are completed.  This will be a slight change for our customers.  Currently during the processes for example, the evening process, SBS is available during the Rollover, Allocation and Confirmation process, and turned off during the Storage Allocation process.  With this change SBS will only be available during the Rollover and Allocation process and remain off during the Storage Allocation and Confirmation process, if a storage allocation is necessary.  I am unsure how you would want to communicate this to your customers.  

Also, Jill will be working on these changes over the weekend, and have Joe confirm her change by Monday the 18th.  Changes should be available for production by Tuesday the 19th.

Jill,
Lynn and Steve January want to change the storage allocation from after confirmation to after regular allocations during all cycles except timely (for the timely cycle it storage allocations will be after confirmations).

I looked at the code and it seemed to be pretty self contained module.  But a few things to look out for:

1) Process for saving to the database
	- after allocations
	- after storage allocations
	- after confirmations
2) rollback of allocations to include storage
3) SBS - currently it turned off for the storage allocation process.  How does it get turned back on?  Business group has to make a decision on how whether SBS needs to turned on or off for the confirmation process

Please let maggie or gerry know the time estimate.

Thanx

The NNG Doc System is now open and  ready for your updates on OBA imbalances.  Please input your updates before Tuesday, June 19th, 5pm.

The reason for the short timeframe is due to the WINDOWS 2000 upgrades on the nights of June 19 & 20 and the unavailability of the DOC system during this time.

Please see me if you have any questions.

Ricki, I just wanted to follow up, I was told Cynthia and Linda neither
one had damage.  Cynthia's mother and sister had flooding and Linda was without
electricity for awhile.  If you are hearing something different, please
let me know.  Thanks. Lynn

Lynn, below was the notice sent to employees that had flood damage.  While I was there, so was TK and she asked me if Linda Ward and Cynthia Rivers were included because she did not see them there.  I just wanted to make sure to pass this on to you.

Thank you,
Ricki

We know that many of you have been severely impacted by Tropical Storm Allison and the devastating flood. Enron cares about you and your family and would like to make sure that your immediate needs are being met. 

To assist you, Enron is providing employees and contractors who have had their houses damaged with $1000 in travelers checks. To receive the checks, please come by EB1625 after 12 noon tomorrow, June 13.   Please be patient as we may temporarily run out of checks depending on the demand.

Please know that the paycheck you will receive on June 30th will be grossed up to account for the taxes that will be taken out if you are an employee. Also please know that you will be asked to sign a certification of your situation in order to receive the funds.

We hope that this helps you and your family. Our thoughts are with you.

Please call Misha Siegel at x37682 should you have any questions.

TW is looking into having a couple of customer meetings, Management needs a list of schedulers for the customers that will be invited. There will probably be a West meeting and a meeting in Houston so they will be done geographically. I am providing the TW Christmas card list as a place to start, so add any new customers and make sure you include the Schedulers names.
I need this by Friday June 15th 4pm.

Lynn, to summarize and remind us of the to do's from the luncheon.

Scott liked having a daily training agenda.
Terry and I should do the Nomination and Scheduling presentation to new hires that was done for IT.
Jacob needs to be scheduled to spend time in Gas Control
Lynn is going to contact Dan Pribble about taking new hires to a compressor station.
Teams need to be comfortable in training new hires in all aspects wheatear they know how long new hires will be on their team.

Other than that Scott and Jacob seemed satisfied with their training and progress in Customer Service.

Subject:	question about TW operational capacity


I found your name on the site, I'm guessing you might be the best person to
lob this question towards...

I'm looking at operational capacity on this site
http://www.tw.enron.com/twdb/etfr_avcap.html
And I can input the gas day, for today or tomorrow.  But when I get results
back it is ambiguous as to which cycle the gas is flowing in.  Are they all
for the timely cycle or are the evening and intraday cycles thrown in there
as well.  And if they are thrown in there, do I just have to know WHEN the
different cycles are posted and use that as my guide (IE if I'm looking at
results around 14:00 those would be for intraday1 cycle)????

Are you even the person I should ask?

Thanks,
Brian Robinhold

Lynn and John
Just to let you know, I have spoke to both Kathy and Lynda regarding the upcoming testing. They have both agreed to assist when their schedules permited. I explained this to Ramona and she said that would be Ok at this point and time. They may require more assistance as this is a large project and needs to go into production on the 15th of July. Please let me know if you are OK with this. Thank you.

Lynn,

As you know, the IT team has been working on the small talk upgrade code changes over the past few months & it has been mved into model office this week for testing. This upgrade is a fairly large change for TMS and will require us to test all screens, functions. Icons, and process which includes approximately 100 screens/reports/processes for each of the pipes. Our deadline to complete this is 7/15/01. If possible, we would like to to ask for both Kathy Washington and Lynda Laferla to assist  us in the testing.  Please let me know if that would be possible.

Thanks Again for your help !
Ramona

Ava & Alma, since I don't know what day's I will be in the office, I have decided to let the two of you set the date on the UPS on-line training.

There is a catch,,,,,,,,, if I miss the overview, you will have to train me....

Ava, would you please reply to Lewis and Verna and let them know what is convenient for you, since you have Reservation Invoices going out next week.

Thank you,
Ricki

Just wanted to check in with you.  Hopefully by today you're feeling pretty good.  Be glad when you get back.  You know I'm stuck here with kids, what a way to start off the morning.  Just rolling along with my new Windows 2000/Outlook, takes some getting used to but we always adapt.  Get some rest and get back here!

Randy, what did this mean to shippers nominating on NNG's pipe?  Do they
have to change their location or POI number for nomination purposes?  If so,
how did we communicate to the shippers.  How does this effect OBA's?
Thanks for the update.  Lynn

Just an FYI about the sell of assets to Western Gas Resources.  With the exception of clearing up a few loose ends involving some accounting issues the sell of the Gomez Plant and related gathering system, the Mitchell CO2 plant and related gathering system, and the pipe between Mitchell Plant and Gomez is complete effective June 1st.

A conference room will not be necessary. You will only need a computer

Anthony Burgs (UPS), Mike Boyd (UPS) and Glenn Lewis (Enron) will be there
to walk you through the transition.  Mike will transfer all your files for
you and set up w/the UPS software (WorldShip). Let me know if you have any

I assumed Kaztex were nominating on the timely, but after our storage discussions at today's Morning Meeting, I need to check.  I will instruct them to do so.  This should then clear up their accounts. 

Thanks!

Chris,

The tariff prohibits us from makeing transfers between storage points, not any NNG policies.   Are they making the nomination from Mid 17 to Demarc Storage on the timely process?  If they are, they should have been able to get injections, as we have not been allocating the timely process the last few days.

Earlier this month, Marketing entered into a negotiated rate deal with Kaztex for one day transport from Demarc to Eagle.  It was Kaztex's intention to withdraw the gas they had in their IDD/Park & Ride account to bring their balance down to zero.  The negotiated rate deal required extensive review and the customer was tendered the contract at 11:52 AM.  Market Services held open the window to accomodate their late nomination.

Herein lies the problem, the Kaztex scheduler withdrew the Park & Ride from the Demarc Storage Point because Demarc was their Primary Receipt Point on the transportat contract.   Instead, they should have withdrew from their Ogden and Mid 17 Storage balances.  To date, they have tried to nominate a transport from the Mid 17 and Ogden points to Demarc Storage but the Storage Nominations continue to be allocated.

I understand it is not Northern's policy to transfer storage between two points without a transportation transaction, however, I would request for this specific case Northern would administer a transfer thus preventing any possible MIC charges at the end of the month.  I estimate the transport revenue being waived to be approx. $44 (2345 MMBtu from Mid 17 Storage * $0.019 plus 720 MMBtu from Ogden at $0 cost).  The negotiated rate deal easily made up this amount.

If you agree with allowing the transfer of the storage balances, please let me know and I will alert the appropriate scheduler and Kaztex.

Thank you for your consideration.

Saying linepack had stabilized, El Paso canceled an Unauthorized Overpull P=
enalty alert Wednesday, one day after it had gone into effect. The pipeline=
 also said it will take Line 1100 between the Eunice and Pecos River statio=
ns down for repairs June 26. Six interconnects will be unable to deliver in=
to El Paso that day, and the total flow of gas through Eunice Station to th=
e South Mainline will be limited to 245 MMcf/d. Plants upstream of Eunice a=
nd in the Monument area will compete for space with San Juan and Anadarko g=
as moving south from Plains Station.=20
NOVA said it must reduce target linepack due to increasing soil and ambient=
 temperatures and to maintenance outages. It is seeking index-based uncondi=
tional tenders through Tuesday for the firm sale of about 200,000 gigajoule=
s. Tenders may be submitted for all or some of the reduction, which will be=
 accomplished through inventory transfers. The gas must be taken in more or=
 less even increments over a period of up to five days starting on or about=
 June 28, 2001. Call Darryn Rouillard at (403) 920-6341 for more informatio=
n.=20
ANR plans to begin maintenance Monday at its Havensville Compressor Station=
 that will run through Oct. 15 and reduce Southwest Mainline capacity by ab=
out 125 MMcf/d. However, based on current flow levels the impact of the wor=
k should be minimal, ANR said.=20
Due to unexpected difficulties in operating the Bisti Station's #8 unit whi=
le the C-1 turbine at the Chaco Plant in northwestern New Mexico is out of =
service, flow from all wells in the GBISTI gathering system should remain s=
hut in until turbine maintenance is complete, El Paso Field Services said. =
The C-1 turbine is expected to return to service June 29. Operators must co=
ntact Troy Chamberlain at (505) 564-4015, Corina Veloz at (505) 599-2357 or=
 the Control Center at (505) 599-2334 before turning wells back on.=20
El Paso said Wednesday evening its Guadalupe Station turbine and the #3 tur=
bine at Pecos River Station #3 turbine had tripped offline unexpectedly. Th=
e Guadalupe unit was returned to service quickly that evening, but attempts=
 to restart the Pecos River unit have been unsuccessful. Capacity through P=
ecos River is limited to 840 MMcf/d until further notice.=20
NGPL reported discovery of a gas quality problem at the Transok-Bryan recei=
pt point in Bryan County, OK. NGPL is working with Transok to resolve the p=
roblem but said if it continues, NGPL may need to cut scheduled volumes at =
the point.=20

Rick, if you have some time on Tuesday, I would like to visit with you
about this.  I don't want this move to be any more negative than what
it is.  I have a possible game plan I would like to talk with you about
and then maybe you and I need to take Larry and Raetta to lunch
give them a chance to talk and then let them know our next steps.
Glad you are back.  Lynn

Here is the email I sent Lynn regarding having Raetta and I on a different floor than the NNG MS Reps.   Again, I am very AGAINST having Raetta and I seperated from the NNG MS reps on a different floor. It will create confusion and be a disruption to our jobs.

See me if you have any questions.

Lynn,

I wanted to express my concerns of having Raetta and I located on another floor, away from the NNG teams.  Raetta and I deal with the MS Reps daily on the following items:

*Approving all Journal Vouchers and Wire transfer requests
*Questions from all NNG reps concerning rates on invoices, volume allocations, imbalances, accounts receivables, etc.
*Sitting in on conference calls with the reps and customers (or marketers) concerning invoices, imbalances, accounts receivable, etc
*Meeting with you every morning and through the day on various customer issues and questions


During the Reservation close cycle (approximately 6 work days), Raetta and I need to be on the same floor with the reps for:

*Reviewing the preliminary invoices (before passing to reps) for unusual high or low dollar amounts
*Assigning new contracts or new customers to reps
*Answering questions from reps about the invoices or rates
*Reviewing TAS error reports for unbilled invoices or processing errors, and correcting them
*Reviewing the Flash report and attending the Flash meeting
*Distribution of the South Region Flash report (Craig Buehler's report) and reviewing it

During the Commodity PPA close cycle (approximately 5 work days), we would need to be on same floor with the reps for:

*Reviewing the preliminary transportation, penalty and imbalances invoices (before passing to reps) for unusual high or low dollar amounts
*Answering questions from reps about the invoices or rates
*Reviewing TAS and GVA error reports for unbilled invoices or processing errors, and correcting them

During the current month Commodity close cycle (approximately 4 work days), we would need to be on the same floor with the reps for:

Reviewing the preliminary invoices (before passing to reps) for unusual high or low dollar amounts
*Assigning new contracts or new customers to reps
*Answering questions from reps about the invoices or rates
*Reviewing TAS error reports for unbilled invoices or processing errors, and correcting them
*Reviewing the Flash report and attending the Flash meeting

The total number of days I have just listed are 15 work days. The maximum number of work days a month totals at 22.  Therefore, approximately 3 weeks out of the month, Raetta and I would have to be on the floor daily.  In this totals, I am NOT including the 3 work days it takes me to meet with reps on NNG OBA imbalances to gather and analyze information for the Customer Accounts meeting.

As you can see, it is very important for Raetta and myself to remain on the floor with the MS reps.  See me if you need further details.

Larry

It was good to get your note.  To answer your question, I had my last (hopefully)
surgery last Monday, June 18th.  Everything went well.  I should be back to
work on Tuesday, June 26th.  I was surprised I did not get postponed with the
flooding down in the Medical Center.  I stayed over one night and I was sure
ready to go home the next day.  I really felt for those nurses.  The hospital
(Diagnostic Hospital) was full to capacity since they were helping out the
Medthodist and Herman hospitals.  

Hope all your belongings in storage were OK.  I am so glad ya'll did not have
more damage than you did.  I talked to Ricki yesterday and she has people
starting to come in and redo the walls in her house this week.

I am so glad you told me about Steve Klimesh's mom.  I had not heard about that.
Do you by chance have his address.  I would like to send him a card.  I had lunch
with him right before he left and he was really looking forward to spending time with
his Mom.  

Speaking of parents, how are yours?  Hope they are both doing well.

As soon as Steve gets back we will email you and definitely go to lunch.

Take care of each other.  We sure miss you both.  Lynn"

Subject:	Mt. Jesus Condensate

Delaine,

The Operating Agreement between Northern and KN (now Oneok) entitles Oneok to all condensate and drip liquids removed from any of the Northern pipelines, equipment or facilities upstream of Oneok's Bushton Plant.  That agreement also provides that Oneok will be responsible for picking-up, hauling and providing a detailed accounting of such liquids removed.  In addition Oneok is to pay Northern for the shrinkage attributable to such condensate and drip.  Northern invoices Oneok monthly for a cash reimbursement of the mmbtu's attributable to the condensate removed.

Effective April 2000, Oneok began short paying its invoices.  The table below summarizes the amount shorted through April 2001 as $67, 889.36.  This short payment reflects Oneok's refusal to reimburse Northern for removal of condensate attributable to the Mount Jesus Drip, lease # 71176.  Oneok has indicated to Northern that Oneok's contract hauler contends the liquid removed from Northern's system at this point is water.  In spite of evidence provided by Northern to the contrary, Oneok accepts its contractor's contention, apparently pays a disposal fee, and refuses to reimburse Northern for the mmbtu's lost.  

This location produced condensate prior to the March 31, 1997 agreement and no change to Northern's pipeline operations that would impact condensation dropout has occurred.  Oneok was properly reimbursing Northern prior to April 2000.  In addition, the attached analysis of liquid removed from the location on September 20, 2000, demonstrates that hydrocarbon condensate continues to be collected at the drip.  Northern must insist that compensation for these BTU's removed from Northern's System be made by Oneok.  Your immediate attention to this matter is appreciated.

Thanks

	I just reviewed a vacation report that covers vacation up through 8/15/01.

	There are still a lot of people with a large amount of vacation.  I made an assumption
	everyone is carrying over 40 hours (which is the max) to 2002.  There was still a lot
	of vacation to be taken.

	I would like to meet with a member from each team Friday, September 14, at 2:00
	to review your teams schedule for the rest of the year.  We can meet in my office.

	Thanks. Lynn"

TW is looking into having a couple of customer meetings, Management needs a list of schedulers for the customers that will be invited. There will probably be a West meeting and a meeting in Houston so they will be done geographically. I am providing the TW Christmas card list as a place to start, so add any new customers and make sure you include the Schedulers names.
I need this by Friday June 15th 4pm.

An update on our change for the Storage Allocation.  Several questions
have come up over the weekend.  The weekend crew is documenting the
questions.  I have left Mike Bodnar and John Buchanan a phone mail message
to research the questions and concerns on Monday.  Then we will group with
storage and determine what changes need to be made.

One change we talked about on the Sunday morning call with storage is to
be able to use SBS on the non allocated portion of storage.  ie, if we are
allocating injections, then withdrawals should still use SBS.  If we are allocating
withdrawals, then injections should still have access to SBS.  Mike Bodnar will
pursue this enhancement further.  Thanks. Lynn

FYI.  Just to keep ya'll in the loop.  This fix should be ready for test on Monday
and migrated Monday night for Tuesday's use.  This fix will be very beneficial
in minimizing Shipper imbalances on NNG.  Terry and Gerry will work with the teams
to be sure everyone is up to speed on the change.  If you have any questions while I
am out next week, please check with Terry Kowalke or Mike Bodnar.   Thanks. Lynn

FYI, with regards to item (3) below:
SBS will remain off after storage allocations are completed.  This will be a slight change for our customers.  Currently during the processes for example, the evening process, SBS is available during the Rollover, Allocation and Confirmation process, and turned off during the Storage Allocation process.  With this change SBS will only be available during the Rollover and Allocation process and remain off during the Storage Allocation and Confirmation process, if a storage allocation is necessary.  I am unsure how you would want to communicate this to your customers.  

Also, Jill will be working on these changes over the weekend, and have Joe confirm her change by Monday the 18th.  Changes should be available for production by Tuesday the 19th.

Jill,
Lynn and Steve January want to change the storage allocation from after confirmation to after regular allocations during all cycles except timely (for the timely cycle it storage allocations will be after confirmations).

I looked at the code and it seemed to be pretty self contained module.  But a few things to look out for:

1) Process for saving to the database
	- after allocations
	- after storage allocations
	- after confirmations
2) rollback of allocations to include storage
3) SBS - currently it turned off for the storage allocation process.  How does it get turned back on?  Business group has to make a decision on how whether SBS needs to turned on or off for the confirmation process

Please let maggie or gerry know the time estimate.

Thanx

Here are the stored procedures with their parameters in parenthesis.  Most of them are single selects and could be incorporated into SQL in the Excel add-in if desired.  I thought stored procedures would make it easier to separate support for the add-in from support for the code.  The stored procedures are all on the server ETSADHOC, database adhoctest, under my id (dpowell).  I think we want to get the DBA's to move these into a production environment so they are protected (ie: dbo in the etsadhoc database)?

Attached are the volumes and related values(San Juan index) for the La Plata ""A"" Fuel from September 1996 through April 2001.   We need to meet to discuss the issues related to this potential liability of $367k(total volume * SJ index * .05) and subsequent liability.

I am in the Transaction Tax Section.  I talked to Rich Jolly.  He said you might have the volume, BTU and value of gas that was consumed in our Colorado compressor 
station(s) since the acquisition of the La Plata facility.  Can you call me at Ext. 35734 so we can discuss the details of this request?

I have attached a spreadsheet that Elizabeth put together for us for our February invoicing so you can get an idea of the categories and the number of invoices.

These are the 7 categories Elizabeth checks, and how they can be redistributed:

Void Invoices: There are only two of these invoices each month, MSR's can check these, but Marketing will have to communicate when there are additional Invoices that need to be voided.
Delete Line Items: This can also be checked by MSR's but new contracts with these exceptions need to be explained by Marketing to the corresponding MSR for that customer
Volume Adjust: These are also only for exceptional contracts, MSR's can check these exceptions, but Marketing will have to explain exceptions on New Contracts to the corresponding MSR for that customer.
Make-up Volume: MSR's
Adjust Reservation Invoices for change in Credit for Commodity due to make-up: MSR's
Adjust Rate: Marketing
Regenerate Invoice: MSR's

 

We will start checking these for May Accounting,
The TW Team

Subject:	Re: Western Gas Resources   

The shippers behind Gomez have been going to WGR since Jan. 1, 2001 and the shippers at Mitchell CO2 have been aware of the pending sell of NNG assets to WGR since at least Jan. 1, 2001.  All of this gas is going to WGR and none of it returns to NNG.  So this was communicated last year when all this was being planned.

The OBA was not affected with this sell.  The OBA with WGR is one OBA that totalled all points.  They owe us 107,000 dth at the end of last month and we owe them 36,000 dth for fuel usage on the #5 unit at Gomez for the first five months of the year.  All that will be left on WGR's OBA will be Benedum and Midkiff.  Dan Ball and I are working together and hope to have the OBA near zero by the end of July.

I hope this answers your questions, if not let me know.

Randy

Subject:	NSP PowerPac Issues

Lynn,

Following our discussion yesterday afternoon, Reyna and I came back and reviewed the NSP powerpac agreement.  We were specifically looking for language in this agreement which may require us to true up for the customer regardless of whether or not we were allocating storage on a given gas day.  We couldn't put our finger on any language in the current agreement (dated April 1, 2001) that requires us to true up for them, but perhaps we overlooked or misinterpreted something.  We would appreciate guidance from you or Bob using your interpretation of the agreement with regard to the following issues:
According to the current agreement, what are our obligations to true up for the shipper  a) if we have allocated storage for a given gas day? and b) if the shipper fails to enter a nom for a given gas day?  Also, by what time is the true up required to be made? 

We would also like to clarify these same sort of issues for the Great River Energy powerpac, just to be certain that we are all in agreement as to how they are handled.  I'm anticipating that we may have future deals of this nature, so anything we can do to alleviate confusion in future agreements would be beneficial.

Thanks for your help!

No, you are correct. In my haste to get something out to everyone I misstated the concensus of the group. Storage allocations will be the final process in the Timely cycle only.
Thanks for clarifying the point.

Subject:	Changes to Storage allocation and SBS

To summarize the outcome of the meeting this morning....
In the short term:
Storage allocations will continue to be the final process performed during the Timely and Evening cycles
Storage allocations will be before the Confirmation process for the Non-Grid, IntraDay1 and IntraDay 2 cycles / SBS will not be available during the Confirmation process for these cycles 
The changes will be made effective for the gad day of July 6th

For the longer term
Continue the above 
Make modifications to the storage allocatons program to allow SBS availability for storage activity which is the opposite to the activity being allocated (i.e., SBS storage withdrawals when storage injections are being allocated)

Effective Gas Day July 1, 2001, the Richland Center Master Meter will be put in-service and downsteam TBS' (identified below) will be measured at this new meter.

In a conversation with Lenny Klaas (Platteville Team), it was agreed the volumes associated with the amount of gas in the pipe between the master meter and all the town border stations downstream will be calculated at 9:00 A.M. on July 1, 2001.  Lenny will also contact Gas Control in Houston.

Once identified, I will provide these volumes to Market Services to be billed manually to Wisconsin Gas.  I have phoned and provided John Couillard of Wisconsin Gas a written explanation as to what to expect from measurement and billing.

I am pleased to announce the following changes in the Global Risk Management Operations organization: 

Bob Hall will lead operations for Enron Americas. Bob previously served as one of the business controllers for gas operations for Enron Americas, with direct responsibility for Gas Logistics and Volume Management.  The leadership team reporting to Bob will include Peggy Hedstrom (Calgary Operations), Jeff Gossett ( U.S. Gas Risk and South America Operations), Stacey White (U.S. Power Risk), Leslie Reeves (U.S. Gas and Power Confirmations and Settlements), and Bob Superty (U.S. Gas Logistics). 

Brent Price will continue to lead Operations for Enron Global Markets and fulfill his dual role as Chief Accounting Officer for Enron Global Markets. 

I am very pleased to announce that Kevin Sweeney will lead Operations for Enron Industrial Markets.  Kevin brings to his new role extensive risk and operations experience from stints in our Houston, London and Singapore offices.  Kevin fills the role that was previously held by Brenda Herod, who will now report directly to Beth Apollo. 

Beth Apollo will be the Operations Project Manager for the assimilation of EES Wholesale. This will include Deal Capture, Risk Analysis,  Confirmations, and Global Data functions which have been moved into EWS under Global Risk Management Operations.  Successfully leveraging the infrastructure to support the EES business plan will also require close coordination with Gas Logistics, Settlements and the Operational Analysis (OA) process, and Beth will actively coordinate operations efforts with these teams and the commercial teams.  I have asked Beth to project manage the effort to look for opportunities to streamline and improve systems, processes and controls, and to consider alignment, where it makes sense, with existing EWS processes.  Reporting to Beth will be Scott Mills, with a focus on Deal Capture, Risk Analysis and Confirmations, and  Brenda Herod, with a focus on invoicing control guidelines and reporting requirements. 

Beth will also continue to manage the Global Services function, which includes the consolidated DPR process and Global Operations Standards, led by Shona Wilson, and the Global Data function which is lead by James Scribner.

Mike Jordan will continue to lead operations for Enron Europe, working closely with me and other EWS operations leads to insure the proliferation of best operational practices worldwide for Enron.   

Thanks for your continued support especially in exploring and seizing commercial opportunities to strengthen our contributions to Enron.

Keith here are some of the points I observed that were off rate for July 1st. gas day.

                                           Order          24 avg flow
GPM Linam Ranch       55.8                  82.3           +26.5
Shell Tippett                   43.8                  47.0                3.2
Plymouth                          17.0                  29.4              12.4
CRA Mertzon                   38.2                 47.7                 9.5

Mitchell had a 46.5 schedule to us but average 19.8 due to not noticing that they had a schedule to us until 5:00 PM.  that after noon. As you know one of your responsibilities is to monitor ALL  points and make calls to stations that are not on rate and notify scheduling so they can make their calls. Cunningham was on Peak Alert all weekend and we were calling for MAX Injection, Redfield was suppose to be on 50,000 inj. for the weekend but was brought up to 200,000 inj. due to too much gas on the system.  My observation is that if calls would have been made on these points that are long to us it would have helped our situation. I would suggest that you pay close attention all orders for every cycle so that you do not miss a change and to continually review flows vs. orders through out the day.

Chris,

The tariff prohibits us from makeing transfers between storage points, not any NNG policies.   Are they making the nomination from Mid 17 to Demarc Storage on the timely process?  If they are, they should have been able to get injections, as we have not been allocating the timely process the last few days.

I assumed Kaztex were nominating on the timely, but after our storage discussions at today's Morning Meeting, I need to check.  I will instruct them to do so.  This should then clear up their accounts. 

Thanks!

Chris,

The tariff prohibits us from makeing transfers between storage points, not any NNG policies.   Are they making the nomination from Mid 17 to Demarc Storage on the timely process?  If they are, they should have been able to get injections, as we have not been allocating the timely process the last few days.

Sue

Earlier this month, Marketing entered into a negotiated rate deal with Kaztex for one day transport from Demarc to Eagle.  It was Kaztex's intention to withdraw the gas they had in their IDD/Park & Ride account to bring their balance down to zero.  The negotiated rate deal required extensive review and the customer was tendered the contract at 11:52 AM.  Market Services held open the window to accomodate their late nomination.

Herein lies the problem, the Kaztex scheduler withdrew the Park & Ride from the Demarc Storage Point because Demarc was their Primary Receipt Point on the transportat contract.   Instead, they should have withdrew from their Ogden and Mid 17 Storage balances.  To date, they have tried to nominate a transport from the Mid 17 and Ogden points to Demarc Storage but the Storage Nominations continue to be allocated.

I understand it is not Northern's policy to transfer storage between two points without a transportation transaction, however, I would request for this specific case Northern would administer a transfer thus preventing any possible MIC charges at the end of the month.  I estimate the transport revenue being waived to be approx. $44 (2345 MMBtu from Mid 17 Storage * $0.019 plus 720 MMBtu from Ogden at $0 cost).  The negotiated rate deal easily made up this amount.

If you agree with allowing the transfer of the storage balances, please let me know and I will alert the appropriate scheduler and Kaztex.

Thank you for your consideration.

	Shelley, we had our weekly TW imbalance meeting this morning and I think
	you will be very pleased next week to see the progress the team has made.
	
	They have come up with plans for both the dollar valued and volumetric
	imbalances.  We have ensured the volumetric imbalances have not grown
	this last week and will continue this effort.   

	TK, Darrell and Dan are bringing suggestions to the table to look at the economics
	of what the customers are doing.   We will continue to monitor throughout
	this week and weekend and be ready for an update on Tuesday.

	Hope you both are having a great vacation.  See ya next week.  Lynn"

Lynn,
We really need to start the X12 exchanges -- I am sure you will agree in
light of the events over the weekend.  I will push from my end and hopefully
you can push from yours and we can make this happen!

(Hope I see you at the Interconnect Meeting in October.)  I told Cheryl
Snyder to be sure both us were on her invitee list.  I think she'll be
sending out the notice soon.

Happy 4th from Colorado Springs,
Kathy

Tammy and Mike,

What's the status of our X12 file exchange?  Are we ready to implement
this?


Due to the latest problems in communication between our schedulers, we
probably should get this in place as soon as possible.  I believe it
would
streamline the confirmation process between our two pipes.

Let me know what I can do on this side to expedite getting this
going....

Kathy

Attatched is our rework of Charlies ""Check Valve"" reimbursement proposal.
As you can see, we have expanded the scope of this potential agreement to
address several issues and put in place a mechanism to continue to make
progress towards the best gas segregation fix we can come up with in the
Holcomb area.  Please get us your comments and revisions as soon as
possible.  Let me know if you have questions.

I just wanted to let you know that I will need to leave today around 4:00.  At this time, I don't know the actual flight time for tomorrow,  but it could be as early as 3:30.  I will be on vacation Monday , Tuesday and possibly Wednesday.  I will send out a separate message to everyone once I have flight arrangements finalized.

Sorry for being so evasive, but things are still in a state of turmoil for me.

Thanks for understanding,

Shelley has never requested anyone to cover for her.  I have asked her before if she required coverage, and she told me no, and its because she is so self sufficient.  If she needs anything, she ususally asks Ava, since she is the closest and I always take my lap top with me.

Have things changed and no one told me?

Thank you,

	Rick, Mike and Jodie, we reviewed the attached recommendation and wanted to pass on
	an idea to you. On NNG, we are trying to ensure new or existing meters do NOT come on without
	a schedule volume to ensure proper billing.  Since TBS' on NNG do not always have a scheduled 
	volume tied to it, we may need to ensure the volume is covered at the Zone level by the shipper.  
	Do you think this is something the Measurement Desk could help the field with?  We certainly
	would be glad to help in any way on the scheduling side. This is especially important for new meters
	as we go through the billing process.  
	Just a thought.  Thanks. Lynn

Mike, thank you for the update.  My only concern now is the file Jeff
sent us last night took 13 hours to load (I am not sure it ever loaded).
I know Jeff is diligently working on this, hopefully he can get this fixed
this weekend.  Tammy has a call into Jeff to see if we need someone available
this weekend to help test.  Thanks again for your support and follow up.

Tammy & Jesse,

Just wanted to touch base with you on todays activities.
We have address the problem with Utilicorp and you will now see 40 records on all meters.
A test file has been sent and Jesse notified. Please let me know of any further problems
that may develope on this file.
Jesse has notified me that the Entex file had a problem and will let me know what the point 
of failure item is. We will move to correct this immediately.
I have not heard if there were any problems with the Texaco files.

Any problem that we find will any EDI file will be resolved and that resolution will be implemeted 
for ALL EDI files. Like the 40 record problem on Utilicorp.

I want to be sure and emphisize that EDI is our top priority right now and we have every intention
to have these files ready on close night. If by some chance we still have problems the night of close
we will continue to resolve them to get the files out ASAP. Unlike the MIPS system, PGAS enables
us to run the EDI file over and over till we have what we need from the system. As long as the customers 
knows that we are redeveloping the file we send them they should understand that there MAY be a 
delay in them getting their data. I do not intend for this to occur but they may need a heads up if you
have not already done that. 
The backup plan for all of this is fairly simple, Other than a copy of the statements there is not one.
Going back to MIPS is not an option. The June data has not been entered into MIPS(except EFM)
and will not be available. Utilicorp already receives a number of copies of the statements. If there is 
someone or some department that would also need a copy in the event of a delay in the file we will sent 
it to them.

If you have any questions regarding the EDI files please feel free to contact me.
I am currently working an afternoon to evening shift so will not be available in the morning
except by pager.(713-813-8096)
Tks, Jeff

Subject:	EDI Measurement Update

Provided below are some bullets outlining today's events.  The fact that we can now translate the EDI file is a giant step forward in the testing process.  Jesse and Jeff has done an outstanding job of getting us to this next step today.  

Let Utilicorp know we are committed to our delivery date of Wednesday.
For the Utilicorp file,  the biggest problem was the missing 40 records.  The 40 record contains the volume (quantity).  When the 40 record is missing, the translator stops processing the file so no file is sent to Utilicorp.  By Friday afternoon,  the problem with the 40 record has been resolved for testing.   
The trailer record is incorrectly being sent as a 40 record. Jeff will have David fix it from home and resend this weekend.  
Now that the files are able to be translated.  I will review test files for any data issues and report results.
The HPL file sent to Texaco contains several occurrences of a ""?"" in the tube inside diameter, tap type, and meter type fields.  When this situation occurs, the meters' with the ""?"" are sent to an error directory.  The error directory information is sent to the Measurement department to correct.  Once the data is corrected, the meters will be resent.   I am trying to find someone to take ownership for HPL since Enron sold it.  

Regards,

Tammy"

We would like to have a meeting to discuss how we should/want to handle scheduling alternates versus TI above our sustainable capacity level at interconnect points.  I don't know what everyone's schedule looks like so I will throw out Tuesday (July 10th) or Wednesday (July 11th) in the afternoon as options.  We will probably need at least an hour.  What times are best?  Is there anyone else I need to include?

Steve,

Our first thought on this was to make it a volumetric agreement.  But now, we are re-thinking that we would like to have a dollar-valued OBA with daily cash out.  Guardian wanted a copy of our agreement today, but since we plan to re-draft, I've told them that it will be a couple of weeks before they get a draft from us.  So, please disregard this and I'll be sending you a new OBA draft sometime within the next week or two.  Thanks!

Steve and Gary,

Attached is the standard volumetric OBA agreement that NNG normally uses.  However, we have made some changes to it in paragraph #7 - Other provisions - in an attempt to tighten it up a bit.  Please let me know ASAP if you have any problems with the language.  Thanks!

(Embedded image moved to file: pic15724.pcx)
                           Concur Expense (XMS)
                             Common Questions


   1.  Where can I find online documentation on Concur Expense?
   Answer: Documentation on Concur Expense is stored in the ISC Document
   Library.   Go to the following link:
   http://isc.enron.com/site/doclibrary/user/default.asp  and click on the
   XMS - Concur Expense folder on the left.

   2. How can I sign up for Concur Expense training and how much does it
   cost?
   Answer: Go to the following link:
   http://iscedcenter.enron.com/docentlm/login.htm.  Log in using your
   Enron email address.  Enter your birth date as the password in the
   following format: MMDDYYYY.  Under the Courses section, select Concur
   Expense (XMS).  This will show the training schedule.  Click the Enroll
   button to sign up for a class.  The cost is $250.

   3. Will old XMS expense reports be converted to the new Concur Expense
   system?
   Answer: No.  History data was not converted to the new system because of
   our move to an Application Service Provider (ASP) solution for Concur
   Expense.

   4. How can I view my old expense reports?
   Answer: Call the ISC Customer Care group at 713-345-4727.  The ISC will
   be responsible for printing out old expense reports and forwarding them
   to you.  Other options are being reviewed to allow you to view old
   expense reports.

   5. Are there any Enron specific help instructions for Concur Expense?
   Answer: Yes.  If you log into Concur Expense, you will see a link to
   Enron Help on the Concur Expense home page under the Company Links
   section.  Also you will see a button for Enron Help at the top of the
   screen when entering expense reports.

   6. Is Enron's Travel Policy available in Concur Expense?
   Answer: Yes. If you log into Concur Expense, you will see a link to
   Travel Policy on the Concur Expense home page under the Company Links
   section.  Also you will see a button for Travel Policy at the very top
   of the screen when entering expense reports

   7. What if I am unable to see any of my credit card charges in Concur
   Expense?
   Answer: Since there are a number of factors that could cause this
   problem, it is best to call the ISC Customer Care group first.  The ISC
   will research the problem and get back to you with an answer.

   8. Does Concur Expense have a time-out feature?
   Answer: Yes.  Concur Expense will automatically time out after 20
   minutes of inactivity.

   9. How do I enter foreign currency into Concur Expense?
   Answer: Go to the ISC Document Library described in #1 above.  Go to the
   XMS - Concur Expense folder.  Next go to the Special Procedures folder
   and following the directions stated in the document called Add a Foreign
   Currency Expense to an Expense Report.

   10. Are there any other sources to quickly get me started using Concur
   Expense?
   Answer: Yes.  Concur Expense provides a Quick Tour for new users.  Log
   into Concur Expense and click the Help button in the top right corner of
   the screen.  Then click the button labeled Quick Tour at the top of the
   help screen.  The ISC intranet home page also contains some helpful
   information.  The following link summarizes some of the topics discussed
   above:  http://isc.dev.corp.enron.com/site/XMSchange.htm.

   11. Can you quickly describe some of the internal changes in the new
   Concur Expense system?
   Answer:  There are minimal changes in the new upgrade.  Here is a list:
   ?  The first screen only has one tab instead of two
   ? New expense types were added
   ? Attendees and approvers will now be printed on the expense reports
   ? Manager and receipt dunning notices will be sent out
   ? The statistical order and statistical WBS element fields have been
     separated out


   Please direct all other questions to the ISC Customer Care group at
   713-345-4727.

Lynn:

This is a busy place and I know you're quiet busy also.  Sometimes the only alternative to communications is emails.

I just wanted to get in touch with you and just let you know that this facility was finally sold.  The buyer is EOTT.  I have been offered a position with EOTT and their benefits seem to be comparable to Enron's however there are some changes.  After 19 years I hate to leave Enron, so I just wanted to see if you would keep me in mind if any positions become available.  Working in the scheduling and nominations area for you with NNG has been the most rewarding experience in my career and I would love to get back to an areas where I felt that I excelled.  I know that there has been some changes in the last few years, however, there is nothing holding me back at this time.   I certainly would have stayed if my family situation would not have been what it was 5 years ago.  I was not looking for a job, God just seemed to drop it down at  time that I needed to do something.  

Speaking of family, my daughter J'Nel has grown up to be a wonderful, beautiful, responsible and extremely lovable daughter.  We have become such great friends.  The adolescence years gave both of us some major growth in our lives for the best.  She is living in England right now, working and going to college.     I am very proud of her.

We are in a transition month, we become EOTT employees effective August 1.  I will try to touch base with you i the next couple of days.

Thanks for your consideration.

Nelda

Looks like we are on track to resolve all outstanding requirements except the prior month imbalance.  The data we need is not currently available by point, only contract.  Perhaps a meeting with IT Accounting Support would be the best next step.  Also, it would be nice to turn over the code we have to someone in IT for long-term implementation.  Lynn what are your thoughts?"

Subject:	United Parcel Service (UPS) Letter Centers Now Open

As part of the recently negotiated agreement with United Parcel Service (UPS), Enron employees may now utilize two new letter centers when sending packages after hours.  These letter centers are located in Three Allen Center, on the ground level, behind the down escalator, near the U.S. Postal Services self-service area and in the Enron Building, at the back of the escalators near the automated teller machine.  

Letter-sized envelopes, as well as boxes up to 18""x 13"" x 3"" can be shipped via Next-Day Air, Second-Day Air, Third-Day Select, UPS International and UPS World-Wide Express Service.  

In order to eliminate service disruptions, please apply a completed label to the envelope or box, in accordance with previously communicated shipping instructions.  When utilizing the shipping documentation available at the letter center, please include the Enron account number and your company code and cost center in the reference fields.  

Pick up times at the letter centers are 7:45 p.m. for Three Allen Center and 8:00 p.m. for the Enron Building, Monday through Friday.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact Glenn Lewis, Global Strategic Sourcing contract manager at 713-646-7512."

It appears that Citizens is continuing to overschedule volumes, thus the oba is still getting bigger.  Even though this oba will probably be cashed out, should we allow them to continue to ""overschedule""?
They have also been in a penalty situation the past few months.  When we do cash out, I think that we should deduct these penalties from their payment.

John,

Please forward the following message to NNG reps:


On Wednesday, July 11, Wisconsin Gas will begin sending EDI confirmations to NNG at all points that they confirm.  The first EDI file should come in for the July 12 Timely Cycle.  Wisconsin Gas will send NNG the confirmation and NNG will respond with the confirmation response and, if applicable, an unsolicited response on line items NNG has that Wisconsin Gas did not send.  Wisconsin Gas will not be sending a confirmation response quick response.  This confirmation process will be similar to WEPCO's confirmation process.

Thanks,
Mary"

A representative with Cedar Falls Utility contacted the NNG measurement desk about volumes for the current gas day changing on the Operator Confirmation Summary.
 
Issue:
 
The daily PGas extract is including partial volume with an Incomplete flag for the current gas day (not closed).  The MIPS extract did not process current gas day volumes.  The Operator Confirmation Summary in TMS displays the incomplete volume to the TMS scheduler and to external customers thus impacting the imbalance calculation.
 
Possible Solution:
1.	Hold the data pole file until gas day is complete
2.	Modify downstream system to process the incomplete flag to ignore current day volumes 
3.	Modify the PGas extract so that current day volume will not be included.

Solution:
 
PGas IT staff will modify the PGas extract so that current day (non closed) volumes will no longer be included in the file.  This will make the extract identical to the MIPS daily extract file it replaces.  TMS IT staff will modify the Operator Confirmation Summary in TMS to display the flow codes included in the extract.  The flow codes are as follows:
 
Blank     = Complete record
I             = Incomplete record
*             = Complete but edited record
 
Mike Sullivan with provide a work plan and implantation date.  If you have any question call me at 713-853-1534.

Thank you

From: 	ETS General Announcement/ET&S/Enron@ENRON [mailto:IMCEANOTES-ETS+20General+20Announcement_ET+26S_Enron+40ENRON@ENRON.com]  On Behalf Of Stan Horton, Chairman & CEO@ENRON
Sent:	Friday, July 13, 2001 1:15 AM
To:	Enron Transportation Services Everyone@ENRON
Subject:	Enron Cost Savings Guidelines


Effective, July 1, 2001, a number of measures and recommendations were implemented to reduce costs associated with travel, entertainment and professional services throughout Enron.  As ETS employees, it is our responsibility to follow the Enron-wide cost-savings guidelines below:

Travel and Business Expenses

?	Air Travel - Reducing air transportation costs is Enron's top priority.  Please take advantage of Enron's negotiated discounted airline fares by using ClickTrip, the Enron-managed online travel booking service, located at <http://clicktrip.enron.com/enron>.  Although use of Travel Agency in the Park (""TAP"") or the Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS)-approved preferred travel agency for your location are still available, ClickTrip is the tool we should all use.

ClickTrip provides employees easy access to all travel and pricing options for their destination (excluding proprietary carriers) and assists employees in making the most cost-effective travel decisions by providing the most current information.  In addition to bringing an estimated savings of 20%, ClickTrip is easy to use and is accessible 24 hours a day from any internet-enabled personal computer.  After-hours telephone support is also available.

When making travel reservations, please purchase non-refundable coach tickets when flying in the U.S., for these tickets can cost up to 65% less than refundable tickets and can usually be changed, if necessary, for a $100 fee.

?	Lodging and Car Rental - GSS has negotiated preferred rates at a number of worldwide hotel chains, as well as with National and Alamo car rental companies.  For more detailed information, please visit <http://travel.enron.com>.

?	On-line Expense Reporting - All requests for reimbursement of business-related expenses should be made through XMS, the new on-line expense account reporting tool.  Please access XMS at <http://xms.enron.com>.

?	Off-site Meetings - To schedule off-site meetings and events for more than 10 people, please contact Tracy Ramsey, GSS Director, Travel and Transportation Services Portfolio Team at (713) 646-8311.

For information on all travel services, please contact Tracy Ramsey at (713) 646-8311.  


Professional Services

To better leverage Enron's purchasing power, all new professional service expenditure arrangements including legal, financial, accounting, engineering, information technology and others, and those due for renewal, must be negotiated through, or in consultation with, GSS.  Contracts for more than $5,000 must be pre-approved by both GSS and ETS. Prior to engaging GSS, please submit all service requisition forms to Rod Hayslett, Danny McCarty, Phil Lowry or me for business unit approval.  

To comply with the professional service procedure, a Professional Services Requisition form must be completed.  This requisition can be accessed on-line at <http://ibuyit.enron.com/gss/ibuyit/servicesprojectrequestform.xls>, or by contacting Ron L. Smith, GSS Director, Administrative and Indirect Services Portfolio Team at (713) 345-6329.
    
Additional information about Enron's cost-saving initiative will be on ETV, in eBiz and Enron Business, as well as in information booths in the Enron Building.

As we all work together to reduce costs across Enron, please forward additional cost-saving ideas to <recommendationsforcostsavings@enron.com>.  

If you have additional questions, please contact Derryl Cleaveland, GSS Senior Director of Operations, at (713) 646-7024.  

Stan

    I do not understand this schedule.  Where is Diana and Renee in the evenings?  Also can you give
    me the schedule for the weekends now that you have Diana and Renee on the weekends?
    Plus I would like to know what customers you gave Diana and Renee from a scheduling perspective
    and what you took away from them from an accounting perspective to even the workloads.
    Could one of you schedule some time with me and John to review the above questions?
    Thanks. Lynn

Lynn,
    The team has decided that we only need one primary evening person, which is Shirley Walden.  In the event that Shirley is out of the office, the team will use a rotational schedule between all team members to cover the evening shift.  I have attached a tentative schedule for evening coverage. If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks.

I have an initial estimate of about 8 hours of work on the PGAS side.  I have asked Jeff to let me know when they plan to do the work and will let you know.

A representative with Cedar Falls Utility contacted the NNG measurement desk about volumes for the current gas day changing on the Operator Confirmation Summary.
 
Issue:
 
The daily PGas extract is including partial volume with an Incomplete flag for the current gas day (not closed).  The MIPS extract did not process current gas day volumes.  The Operator Confirmation Summary in TMS displays the incomplete volume to the TMS scheduler and to external customers thus impacting the imbalance calculation.
 
Possible Solution:
1.	Hold the data pole file until gas day is complete
2.	Modify downstream system to process the incomplete flag to ignore current day volumes 
3.	Modify the PGas extract so that current day volume will not be included.

Solution:
 
PGas IT staff will modify the PGas extract so that current day (non closed) volumes will no longer be included in the file.  This will make the extract identical to the MIPS daily extract file it replaces.  TMS IT staff will modify the Operator Confirmation Summary in TMS to display the flow codes included in the extract.  The flow codes are as follows:
 
Blank     = Complete record
I             = Incomplete record
*             = Complete but edited record
 
Mike Sullivan with provide a work plan and implantation date.  If you have any question call me at 713-853-1534.

Thank you
Dale Ratliff
